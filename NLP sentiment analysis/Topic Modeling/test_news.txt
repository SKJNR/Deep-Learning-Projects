In order to implement the National Education Policy, 2020 in the state, the education department has now formed various committees to give their suggestions and recommendations to the government.In a government resolution released on September 8, the department announced the formation of a five-member coordinating committee which would collate suggestions received from experts. The coordinating committee, consisting of officials from Pune and Chandrapur Zilla Parishads, State Council of Educational Research and Training and state’s publishing bureau Balbharti has to submit its report to the government by October 15.“The committee will collate the suggestions received from various stakeholders in the past and in the coming days. A draft guideline would be prepared for its implementation in the state,” states the GR.After the Union cabinet passed the National Education Policy 2020 last month, the state education department held several consultations with experts and stakeholders over its implementation.“All the suggestions and recommendations made in these consultation meetings shall be taken into consideration for the report,” said a member of the coordinating committee.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address a conclave on “School Education in 21st Century” under the National Education Policy-2020 (NEP-2020) on Friday through video-conference.The Ministry of Education is organising the two-day conclave, which started on Thursday, as a part of the “Shiksha Parv”, the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said in a statement.The “Shiksha Parv” (education festival) is being celebrated from September 8-25 to felicitate teachers and take the New Education Policy forward. Various webinars, virtual conferences and conclaves on several aspects of the NEP are being organised across the country, the PMO said.Modi had also delivered the inaugural address at the “Conclave on Transformational Reforms in Higher Education under NEP-2020” on August 7 and addressed the “Governors’ Conference” on the policy on September 7.The prime minister has been championing the NEP and speaking to the stakeholders, highlighting its features and backing wide consultations to address everyone’s concerns as it is implemented.The NEP-2020 is the first education policy of the 21st century, which was announced 34 years after the previous National Policy on Education in 1986. The NEP-2020 is directed towards major reforms at both the school and higher education level, the government has said.The new National Education Policy aims at making the country an equitable and vibrant knowledge society. It envisions an India-centred education system that will contribute directly to transforming the country into a global superpower, the government has said.
With the state government’s decision to stay admissions to first-year junior college (FYJC) in line with the Supreme Court’s interim stay on the Maratha reservation in jobs and education, colleges said they are worried about the academic year of these students.The general admission rounds to FYJC usually conclude by August every year after which colleges begin. This year, however, due to the late declaration of the Class 10 results with the ongoing Covid-19 crisis, the process began in August and only one admission round has concluded so far. With the stay on the admission process until further orders, colleges are now worried about completing the syllabus and conducting exams for Class 11.Usually, colleges begin by August and we conduct the first unit test by September. Then the first terminal exam is usually conducted before the Diwali break.“This year, however, the entire schedule has gone haywire and we don’t know if there will be enough time to teach even with the reduced syllabus,” said Satram Verhani, vice-principal, CHM college, Ulhasnagar. Verhani said that the education department can consider pushing the academic year for these students up to June instead of April.Vidyadhar Joshi, vice-principal at VG Vaze college,Mulund said that since Class 11 students are not known to the teachers, it might be a challenge to understand their learning needs in an online only mode.“Getting used to the students is difficult because teachers have not seen students in the past. This is going to be a challenge for both the teachers and students,” he added.On Tuesday, the department released an official statement announcing a postponement of the Second Merit List which was supposed to be declared that day after the supreme court stayed the Maratha quota in jobs and education. ‘The list is postponed and the admissions are stayed until further notice. Revised timetable for FYJC admissions would be released later after getting instructions from the state government,’ stated the official statement released by the department.
Gareth Bale completed his return to Tottenham from Real Madrid on Saturday when defender Sergio Reguilón also signed for the Premier League club from the Spanish champions. The 31-year-old Bale is back in north London on a season-long loan move, seven years after the winger joined Madrid for 100 million euros (then $132 million), which was a world record fee at the time.Reguilón, a 23-year-old left back, has joined Tottenham permanently on a contract through 2025. Reguilón, who made his Spain debut in the Nations League this month, won the Europa League in August while on loan at Sevilla.Bale struggled for game time in recent seasons at Madrid and is seeking to rediscover his motivation for the game under manager Jose Mourinho at Tottenham, where he is set to form an exciting-looking forward line with Harry Kane and Son Heung-min.Bale won four Champions League titles at Madrid after leading Tottenham into the competition for the first time in 2010 and producing dazzling displays that ultimately earned the move to La Liga.Now Bale returns to a Tottenham side trying to return to the Champions League after failing to qualify this season due to a sixth-place finish in the Premier League.Tottenham opened the new season a with a loss to Everton and is currently having to go through qualifying to make the Europa League group stage.

Actor Urmila Matondkar has shot barbs at Kangana Ranaut for speaking against Mumbai and recently comparing it to Pakistan occupied Kashmir. Urmila said that Kangana should first take stock of her home state of Himachal Pradesh before attacking Maharashtra or Mumbai.Kangana recently invited a huge controversy when she called the Mumbai Police inefficient for the way they handled the Sushant Singh Rajput case. She added that she didn’t feel safe in the city anymore. Multiple celebrities had objected to her statement, including a few politicians.Now, in an interview with India Today, Urmila said that Kangana ought to know of the drugs situation of her own state. “The entire country is facing the menace of drugs. Does she (Kangana) know Himachal is the origin of drugs? She should start from her own state,” she told India Today. “If one person shouts all the time, doesn’t mean the person is speaking the truth. Some people want to crib all the time and play the victim card and if all that fails, they play the woman card,” she added.“Why did this person who has been given Y-security from the taxpayers’ money didn’t give information about the drug nexus to the police?,” she added. In a tweet, Kangana she had said: “Sanjay Raut Shiv Sena leader has given me an open threat and asked me not to come back to Mumbai, after Aazadi graffitis in Mumbai streets and now open threats, why Mumbai is feeling like Pakistan occupied Kashmir?”After Kangana’s remarks against Mumbai, Shiv Sena leaders had told her against returning to the city. She was the provided the Y-plus security by the home ministry for her protection as she arrived back from Manali.Kangana, before leaving for Himachal Pradesh on Monday, reiterated her PoK barb, which had riled the Sena. She has tweeted that she has been terrorised with “constant attacks and abuses” and that her analogy comparing the Maharashtra capital with PoK was “bang on”.
Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank on Tuesday announced that the country’s 1,242nd Kendriya Vidyalaya will be set up in the Indian Institute of Technology Indore campus.He said the move will be a “unique combination of higher and school education”.Taking to Twitter, Nishank said, “I am very happy to share that a new name is going to be added to the vast chain of Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan. The orders are being issued today (Tuesday) to open a Central School in the campus of IIT Indore.”“I believe that the establishment of Central School in the campus of IIT Indore will be a unique combination of higher and school education. Warmest congratulations to all the students and parents who are going to be benefited,” he further tweeted.
As the education secretary during whose tenure the National Education Policy (NEP) process started, I am fortunate to see its completion. I congratulate my successors who, as policy managers, made it happen, navigating the minefield on something as contentious as the education policy. This could not have been possible without the visionary stewardship of K Kasturirangan.In policymaking, the paths chosen are the most important. Following best practices everywhere is one path. But will it be equitable and achievable in a country like India? The challenge in choosing paths in policy is not choosing what seems best, but also ascertaining whether the best is workable. Is it equitable enough or an attempt at branding which helps only a small percentage? Does the architecture exacerbate exclusion, while paying lip service to inclusion? These are the touchstones on which the policy must be assessed.There are different approaches to policymaking. One can change the question to suit the answers. Any government will have its low-hanging fruit and even ideological baggage. If it prioritises these elements, the government can change the questions. That would be an opportunistic compromise. But it has happened in the past. The second approach is to retain the questions, but come out with answers which are convenient to handle. That would be dishonest and unauthentic. On these two counts, NEP passes muster; it has done neither. But there is a third approach. Retain the questions, give attractive answers, knowing fully well that neither the political economy nor the ecosystem of education will have the capacity to meet the challenge head-on. Past policies fell short despite valiant efforts because there was no willingness to do things that are not necessarily popular. Sacking teachers, introducing differential salaries on performance, ensuring the attendance of teachers, calls for a degree of tenacity which has been missing. It is one thing to have a vision document and quite another to have a policy. Policy is meant for praxis. It is to be implemented effectively for impact. It is the prerogative of the government to prepare and choose a policy option among different policy choices, and use its special power to resolve conflict arising out of it. On NEP, here are some first-cut problems.The first problem of NEP is arriving at a budget of 6% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for education with the states and the Centre striving to reach it. In reality, with 50% of the population below the age of 25, what is perhaps required is more than 10% of GDP. If a stand is taken that education, though under the Concurrent List, is mostly under the purview of the state, thus, the responsibility of states, we are running faster to stay in the same place. The Kothari Commission in 1966 suggested 6% of GDP as the advised outlay. After 54 years, we are nowhere near that. States, which have been further impoverished after the Goods and Services Tax (GST) came into effect, will be hit by a double whammy if this is passed on to them. The Centre will have to arrive at a mechanism to incentivise states and carefully take into account what states can really spend on their own. This requires reconfiguring existing budgetary priorities.The second problem is historical and centred on what the government intends to do with its institutions. An overwhelming majority of India’s population is financially stressed, and cannot seek services beyond government institutions or questionable private institutions. Education and health costs are similar. They are essential but tend to become expensive unless government institutions are accessed.So it is the same set of institutions, and the existing cohort of teachers and professors, which will be enjoined to deliver new outcomes. One-and-a-half million teachers, whose presence is more marked by absence, and professors who are not sure how the classes will fill up, are to be repurposed. Issues such as changes in the ecosystem, supervisory structure, and incentives and disincentives are too complicated to be left entirely to the states. My suggestion is that the transfer of money from the Centre for education should be contingent on a reform plan being implemented by the states.The third problem is an alarming fall in returns to education. From the enrolment of nearly 100% students at the primary level, it becomes 72% at upper primary, 52% at secondary, 43% in higher secondary and only 20% to levels above higher secondary. The National Statistical Office (NSO) reports show a clear deterioration in access between 2014 and 2018. It is as much a function of poor quality education and a lack of interest on one hand, and sharply falling returns to education on the other. The tragedy in India has been more unemployment for better-educated people. While the survey shows 6.8% as the unemployment rate, for school graduates it is 10.7%, for college graduates, it is 13.2%, and it is 35% for women graduates (CMIE data). Discrimination makes the picture more complicated. A jobless world, which is likely to further deteriorate with artificial intelligence and automation, is not the ideal place to think in terms of 50% gross enrolment ratio (GER) only because China adopted that figure and succeeded.There are other issues too. Introducing early childhood care and education through the anganwadi workers is an attempt to face a brave new world with a rusted system. In most places, these workers may not even be trainable. How well NEP has been designed in the context of India will depend upon how well the capacity is commensurate with efforts. After all policies are designed, not conceived in an inspired burst.Satya Mohanty is former education secretary, MHRD, Government of IndiaThe views expressed are personal
Offering clues about his broader worldview, the Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden, has spoken glowingly about India. But Mr Biden also made one or two critical comments about the Narendra Modi government’s policies, for instance on Kashmir. All of this had led to much debate in India — most of which reads too much into far too little.A United States (US) presidential candidate will make comments to please different voter and funding groups. These comments will sound contradictory because, at this point, they are far from having a well-thought-out foreign policy programme. A non-incumbent candidate will be particularly prone to have little or no view on what are marginal issues that do not affect US voters. This US election is unusually dominated by domestic issues, with a sprinkling of concern about China. All else is immaterial.What matters is how much the core foreign policy views of the candidates differ from the mainstream. And this is where Mr Biden’s comments are reassuring. He sees China as the primary strategic challenge of the US, making India geopolitically vital. He puts climate and terrorism as overriding global concerns, which resonates with New Delhi. On immigration and trade, he promises to be more generous than President Donald Trump. His foreign policy aides have indicated differences with India will be left to the diplomats to resolve. In other words, the drivers of the US-India relationship are shared by both candidates and India has little to worry about if a new administration comes to power.
The 13th edition of Indian Premier League is set to kick off from Saturday with the long-time rivals Mumbai Indians and Chennai Super Kings going head-to-head in Abu Dhabi. The last time the two teams met, it was the Rohit Sharma-led MI that triumphed over MS Dhoni-led CSK by 1 run. But that 1 run made all the difference in the world as Mumbai Indians won the IPL trophy for the fourth-time, becoming the only franchise to do so.CSK, who lost all four games to Mumbai last year, will be eager to kick things off on a positive note with a win. All eyes will be on CSK captain MS Dhoni, who will be returning to cricket after nearly 14 months.IPL 2020 Full CoverageAhead of what promises to be a cracker of a contest, Kolkata Knight Riders co-owner Shah Rukh Khan sent his best wishes to both the teams.In a tweet, the Bollywood superstar wrote: “All the best to @ChennaiIPL & @mipaltan for today’s match. Wishing all the players to be healthy and have a good game. Do well @ImRo45 & @msdhoni. Can’t wait to watch you boys! Big hug from 6 feet away.All the best to @ChennaiIPL & @mipaltan for today’s match. Wishing all the players to be healthy and have a good game. Do well @ImRo45 & @msdhoni Can’t wait to watch you boys! Big hug from 6 feet away. — Shah Rukh Khan (@iamsrk) September 19, 2020Meanwhile, when Sachin Tendulkar was asked to react on the MI vs CSK rivalry, he said for any tournament to be successful you need rivals.“For any tournament to succeed you need rivalries. Mumbai Indians, as well as Chennai Super Kings, have a very very strong fan base. Both are extremely competitive.“There have been occasions where you know Mumbai Indians were pushed badly in a corner and we’ve been able to pull through and win that game and the same thing has happened also with Chennai Super Kings. It makes that competition unpredictable and when there is an element of unpredictability people get glued to the television sets that is the beauty of any sport. But when it’s played at the highest level and so fiercely competitive people like to see that and this year also it’s not going to be any different,” Sachin added.
Training students to become national-level players, honing their linguistic potential, uplifting differently-abled children and making students aware about cyber safety are among the initiatives launched by school teachers and principals that have been awarded by the CBSE this year.The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) on Wednesday awarded 38 teachers and principals from its affiliated schools for their valuable contribution towards improving school education, innovation and dedication. Veneketson Karthikeyan, who is a physical education teacher in Indian School, Muscat has shaped his students into national level players of extraordinary calibre.“His numerous students have represented Oman, Qatar national cricket teams. He is a passionate teacher who keeps motivating his students to raise the bar,” the award citation read.Dhannajoy Pan, Principal, DPS Odisha, has been awarded for his teaching philosophy based on inclusive environment that is based on four aspects of growth--physical, mental, emotional and social.Poonam Bhatt, a biology teacher at Amity International School, Ghaziabad, has been awarded for “leading her students in a number of real world projects where students have been able to study various concepts in a much more meaningful way”.Amit Garg, a counsellor at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Delhi, has bagged the award for his “work towards uplifting the differently-abled children through teaching, enabling them to handle daily chores to foster independence”.Shreejith, an IT teacher at Kendriya Vidyalaya in Moscow has “initiated many online activity-based projects in his school like Unbox-21, virtual training and online competitions, online ethics and cyber safety”.The other awardees include Alka Sharma and Yogesh Gambhir from Punjab, Ram Kumar Sharma and Anuja Sharma from Chandigarh, Anita Mishra from Rajasthan, Puneeta Malhotra, Rashmi Malik and Arti Chopra from Gurgaon, Dimple Puri from Noida and Sapna Iyer from Gujarat.Each awardee received a merit certificate, a shawl and a cash prize of Rs 50,000. The awards were presented by Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ in a virtual ceremony.
The Supreme Court on Wednesday dismissed 3 petitions which amongst other things sought postponement of NEET citing Covid 19 and facilitation of candidates in containment zones to write the exam.A bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan said that similar petitions were already dismissed by the top court on August 17 and review petition against that order had also been rejected by the court.“All arrangements have been made. Everything is over. Review petition was also dismissed,” the bench remarked.Senior counsel Arvind Datar appearing for the petitioners pointed out the difficulties of candidates in Bihar to give the exam stating there are only 2 examination centres in the state.“There are only 2 examination centres (in Bihar) - Patna and Gaya,” Datar said pointing out the difficulties which candidates in other parts of the state may face to reach the examination centres.Senior counsel KTS Tulsi and advocate Shoeb Alam, both for other sets of petitioners, highlighted the plight of students in containment zones who won’t be allowed to come out to write the exam.Alam asked the court to issue a direction to treat NEET admit cards as curfew passes so that such students in containment zones will not face difficulties while travelling to examination centres.The bench which also comprised Justices R Subhash Reddy and MR Shah however said that it was not inclined to entertain the matter.Earlier on August 17, the apex court had dismissed a similar plea by students seeking postponement of Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) and NEET 2020 scheduled for September. “Life must go on,” the top court had remarked while dismissing that case.The JEE main exam has already been conducted as per schedule from September 1 to 6.A review petition filed by six ministers from non-BJP ruled states against the August 28 order was also dismissed by the apex court on September 4.NEET is scheduled to be conducted on September 13.
Rajya Sabha is likely to take up the contentious farm bills on Sunday with the Congress and many opposition parties trying to put a united front to oppose these proposed legislations terming them as anti-farmer and pro-corporate, even as the ruling BJP is also reaching out to several regional outfits for support.The numbers, however, appear to be in favour of the ruling dispensation to get these bills passed from Rajya Sabha, while the lower house has already cleared them despite a key NDA member Shiromani Akali Dal vehemently opposing them.Some key BJP leaders are said to be in touch with various non-Congress opposition parties to seek support from their Rajya Sabha members for these bills.While the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance is yet to have a clear majority of its own in the 245-member Rajya Sabha, many regional parties have backed it for the last several sessions to ensure passage of various legislations proposed by the government.BJP leaders expressed confidence that they will get the support of over 130 members, including nine of the AIADMK and six of the YSR Congress -- both of whom are not part of the ruling alliance if a division of votes is sought on these bills.Another regional party, Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) was also being wooed by the BJP, but its chief and Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Saturday asked his party MPs to vote against these bills, alleging these would cause great injustice to farmers in the country.The BJP itself has the highest tally with 86 seats, followed by 40 of the Congress. The three members of the SAD are sure to vote against the bills, but Shiv Sena, a former BJP ally and now in opposition, has expressed it support for these bills. The Maharashtra party has three members in Rajya Sabha.Several other regional parties, including three-member Aam Aadmi Party, Samajwadi Party with eight seats, and BSP with four, have joined the opposition’s ranks in protest against these bills but it may not prove enough to hinder their passage.Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s forceful defence of the three bills and blistering criticism of the Opposition for protesting against them on Thursday made it clear that he remains unfazed by the opposition and that his government will press on to get Parliament’s nod for these measures aimed at opening private avenues for farmers to sell their produce.His assertion came amid Congress and several other parties besides the SAD coming out strongly against these bills, calling them “anti-farmers”. Farmers in states like Punjab and Haryana have been protesting against these proposed laws which, their leaders allege, will end up dismantling the existing government-backed support system they have.A number count of parties that have come out against these draft legislations suggests that there are as of now nearly 100 MPs opposing them. There is no clarity about the stand of some small parties which have around a dozen members put together.Since the Modi government assumed office for its second time in 2019, its rivals have not been able to scuttle any of its major bills due to a rise in the ranks of treasury benches and a corresponding fall in the opposition ranks.The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill were passed by Lok Sabha on Thursday, while the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill was passed on Tuesday.These bills seek to replace ordinances already promulgated by the government. With opposition parties dubbing the three bills as “anti-farmers” and the SAD quitting his government to protest them, Modi refuted their criticism, describing these proposed laws as “historic” and stating that they will unshackle farmers by allowing them to sell their produce anywhere at a better price.A day after resigning from Union Cabinet, senior SAD leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal said she feels “saddened” that her voice in support of farmers was not heard and demanded that the government should pause on these legislations by referring them to a parliamentary panel for wider consultations.The government has presented these bills as pro-farmers, saying these will ensure that farmers get better prices for their produce and do not get subjected to regulations of ‘mandis’.Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar had said on Thursday in Lok Sabha that farmers will be free to sell their produce to anyone and these bills will increase competition and promote private investment, which will help in the development of farm infrastructure and generate employment.However, opposition parties have slammed the bills as “anti-farmers”, claiming that the agriculture sector will be left to the fate of corporate interests. Delhi Chief Minister and AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal also appealed to all non-BJP parties to unite in Rajya Sabha and oppose the three bills that he claimed would leave farmers in the hands of big companies for exploitation.
Indian-origin Senator Kamala Harris, the Democrat’s vice-presidential nominee, and its 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton raked up over USD 6 million at a fundraiser during which the two made fun of US President Donald Trump.“I’ve never seen him laugh,” Clinton said during the virtual event.“I’ve never, ever seen him make fun of himself. Certainly not his hairdo — you know, that’s, something I’m quite experienced. It is really telling that part of the cruelty and the indifference, and just the plain meanness that we see on a regular basis from him, is in part because he has no sense of humour. And, you know, he loves putting people down, not lifting them up,” Clinton said.“I totally agree with you, Hillary,” Harris said of Trump’s personality.“There is nothing joyful about him. There is nothing about him that inspires joy,” Harris said.“And it’s such a shame, really. I mean on one level you just have to feel like, you know, oh, everyone should have something in their lives that gives them the ability to smile a genuine smile,” she said.At the top of the fundraiser, Clinton said the event raised more than USD6 million from more than 100,000 people. She said the average donation was less than USD30.When Clinton was asked what advice she has for Harris ahead of next month’s debate with Vice President Mike Pence, she said Pence will try to somehow subtly undercut Harris.“You know, try to say ‘well you know that’s not the way it’s done,’ or ‘that’s not what we expect or that’s not what we believe,’ trying to somehow put her in the box of, ‘you know, the inexperienced woman candidate.’ And she’s not going to stand for that and she’s not going to put up with it, and she has to modulate her responses because we know there still is a double standard alive and well when it comes to women in politics,” Clinton said.“So, she’s got to be firm, and effective in rebutting any implication that comes from the other side. But to do it in a way that doesn’t, you know, scare or alienate voters. So, it’s a process that she will master during preparation,” said the former secretary of state.The fundraiser was hosted by Maya Khabira Rudolph, an American actress, comedian, singer, and voice actress and Amy Meredith Poehler, an American actress, comedian, writer, producer, and director.“This election is about more than what we’re voting against. It’s also about what we’re voting for a brighter future for all Americans. We know we can’t just go back to the way things were before Donald Trump as Joe says we need to build back better,” Rudolph said.In her remarks, Clinton talked about the wildfires out West in California, Oregon and Washington and the people “suffering so dramatically” from families who lost loved ones and property to those dealing with dangerous air quality levels.“I’m just grateful that today Joe Biden delivered a compelling powerful speech about climate change because we all know that it is driving the intensity of these fires and we have to deal with it, along with our pandemic,” Clinton said.“The ongoing moral reckoning with racism and violence, you know, what we’re up against, but I don’t think the current incumbent of the White House seems to know or more importantly, to care.“The Woodward tapes are stunning,” Clinton said. “We’ve heard tapes of presidents before, but we’ve never heard a president who deliberately kept information from the American people that could have saved lives and misery,” she said.“So, we need a president and a vice president who will show the kind of compassion determination and leadership. That is so desperately missing and needed right now,” Clinton said.Calling Clinton “absolutely extraordinary,” Harris said the former secretary of state has always been a model of what it means to have leadership that puts the country ahead of everything else.“You have been someone who has been a role model to so many of us as women. My mother said often to my sister Maya and me, ‘You may be the first to do many things make sure you’re not the last’, and you have always been that person who not only has broken so many glass ceilings as you have said shattering all of those, those shards that may fall. You, you do it was such grace and you always do it in a way that is about creating a path for others to follow,” she said.“The thing about breaking barriers, you know, some people might think breaking barriers means you start on one side of the barrier and you just show up on the other side of the barrier,” Harris said.“But that’s not what happens, I’m breaking barriers involves breaking things. And when you break things. sometimes you get cut. It’s painful. It’s worth it every single time. But it is not without an extraordinary amount of courage and effort, and Hillary you have broken so many barriers and have shown America, its potential,” Harris said. PTI LKJ ABH ABH

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday targeted the government over the lack of central data on Covid-19 infection among healthcare workers, including doctors, nurses, and support staff, who are at the frontline of the battle against the pandemic.“The beating of ‘thali’ and the lighting of a lamp is more important than security and respect” for the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government, the former Congress president wrote on Twitter while sharing a media report.“Adverse data-free Modi government! The beating of ‘thali’ and the lighting of a lamp is more important than security and respect. Modi Government, why are corona warriors being insulted?” Gandhi asked in a tweet in Hindi.His comments came after Union minister of state for health Ashwini Choubey on Tuesday informed the Rajya Sabha that there is no central data available with the health ministry on Covid-19 infection among the healthcare staff, including doctors, nurses, and support staff.As health is a state subject, no “such data is maintained at central level by the ministry of health,” he told the upper house of Parliament. However, a database regarding the health workers seeking relief under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Insurance Package is being maintained at the national level, he added.After the United States, India is the second country to have the highest number of cases of the coronavirus disease. On Friday, the country reported 96,424 new cases of Covid-19, pushing the tally to over 5.21 million mark.
No single player in history of the IPL has had the kind of connection with a franchise quite like MS Dhoni with CSK. He calls Chennai his second home and one can’t argue. Over the years, Dhoni has not only become synonymous with the team, but can be said to be the face of the franchise. Dhoni has led CSK to unprecedented heights in the IPL, winning the title thrice – the second most after Mumbai Indians – while finishing runner-up five times.Also Follow | IPL 2020 Full CoverageAnd to think that none of that could have been possible had certain things fared differently. S Badrinath, the former CSK and India batsman, has revealed that ahead of the first edition of the IPL, the team management in fact, wanted Virender Sehwag and not Dhoni as its franchise player, but with the former India opening batsman insisting to join Delhi Daredevils, the CSK management opted not to pester him much.Also Read | ‘That would be my role’: Shubman Gill opens up about his batting position for KKR“IPL started in 2008, and if you see who was the first option for Chennai Super Kings, it was Virender Sehwag. The management had decided on picking Sehwag for sure, but Sehwag himself said that he was brought up in Delhi, so he would have a better connection,” Badrinath said on his YouTube channel.Also Read | Ali Khan becomes first American cricketer to join IPL, to play for KKR“The management agreed for him to play in Delhi, thinking it would be better. Then came the auctions, and they saw who was the better player, and before that India won the 2007 World T20. And only then did they decide to sign Dhoni.”With Dhoni winning the inaugural T20 World Cup in South Africa and ushering India into a new era, his stocks raised and the CSK management was convinced of him possessing what it takes to lead the team. Badrinath reckons brining Dhoni on board was a win-win situation for CSK simply because of what he brought to the table as a captain, batsman and wicketkeeper.“In 2008, MS Dhoni was the most expensive player, they bought him for INR 6 crores. Many probably don’t know this story but Dhoni was picked instead of Sehwag. According to me, MS Dhoni coming to CSK was killing three birds with one stone. One, he is one of the best captains the world has ever seen. There is no trophy that he doesn’t have,” he explained.“Second, the best finisher. A finisher is a very important part of all the best T20 teams around the world. Even if you see all the good teams today, Mumbai Indians have Pollard, Kolkata Knight Riders have Andre Russell, CSK have MS Dhoni. And third, he is an excellent wicketkeeper. One of the best and safest keepers I have ever seen.”
The IPL fever is slowly but surely gripping the entire cricketing universe. With the IPL 2020 opener being just seven days away, former cricketers and experts have started to make their way to UAE to be a part of the broadcasting team. Former England batsman Kevin Pietersen was the latest to fly for Dubai to be a part of IPL 2020.The first thing Pietersen did before leaving for Dubai was to predict the winner of this year’s IPL. “Who’s winning? I hope Delhi,” wrote Pietersen on his Instagram handle.Pietersen was recently commentating in the now-concluded T20I series between England and Australia. Now, the former English batsman has left from the shores of Southampton and he has made his way to Dubai.“From a bubble in the UK to a bubble in Dubai...! I love that we have cricket back and as always very excited about working on the IPL,” Pietersen addedDuring his playing days, Pietersen had represented Royal Challengers Bangalore, Delhi Daredevils, and Rising Pune SuperGiants in the IPL.The Shreyas Iyer-led Delhi Capitals are one of three sides in the IPL along with Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab who are yet to win the tournament. The Capitals, however are the only side to have never even reached the finals of IPL.They would be hoping for a change of fortunes with the induction of the likes of Ravichandran Ashwin and Ajinkya Rahane who will bolster their already strong squad in the presence of Rishabh Pant, Shikhar Dhawan, Kagiso Rabada, Prithvi Shaw and captain Iyer.Mumbai Indians and Chennai Super Kings will be locking horns in the opening match of the IPL 2020 on September 19. Dubai will play host to 24 games, 20 matches will be hosted by Abu Dhabi while Sharjah will hold 12 games.The Delhi Capitals start off their campaign in the 13th edition of the IPL against Kings XI Punjab on September 20 at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium in Dubai.The IPL 2020 will be played from September 19-November 10 in the UAE across three venues --Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Sharjah.(With ANI inputs)
Updated: Sep 09, 2020 06:25 ISTOil steadied after its biggest one-day loss in more than two months as growing doubts over the strength of the global demand recovery along with continued weakness in stocks soured market sentiment.Futures in London were little changed after dropping 5.3% on Tuesday to settle below $40 a barrel for the first time since June 15. Asia’s stalling demand recovery, the end of the US summer-driving season and increased supply from the OPEC+ alliance all point to a grim short-term outlook for oil prices.Crude has also been hurt by worsening US-China relations and a retreat in global stocks, partially driven by concerns a Covid-19 vaccine may be delayed. The benchmark S&P 500 Index has fallen 7% over the last three sessions.Brent crude’s break below $40 a barrel follows two months of the global benchmark largely holding between $42 and $45. The coronavirus pandemic is still raging and Bank of America Merrill Lynch said it will take three years for oil demand to fully recover from the outbreak even if there’s a vaccine.Market structures point to more downside risk for oil prices. Contangoes -- where prompt prices are cheaper than later-dated contracts -- are widening for both the global and US benchmarks. That points to increasing concern about over-supply and, combined with falling tanker rates, is also starting to make storing crude at sea an attractive proposition again.At the same time, oil traders have begun seeking out available US onshore storage, according to The Tank Tiger, an independent brokerage and consulting clearinghouse. The return of storage plays that only work when the market is glutted is bad news for producers withholding supply in a bid to prop up prices.

People in England who refuse to self-isolate to stop the spread of coronavirus could face fines of up to £10,000 ($13,000, 11,000 euros) under tough new regulations announced Saturday to tackle a surge in cases.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said this week that Britain was seeing a second wave of Covid-19, and introduced new restrictions for millions of people across northwest, northern and central England.In a further measure announced late Saturday, he said that from September 28 people will be legally obliged to self-isolate if they test positive or are told to by the National Health Service (NHS) tracing programme.“The best way we can fight this virus is by everyone following the rules and self-isolating if they’re at risk of passing on coronavirus,” Johnson said in a statement.“And so nobody underestimates just how important this is, new regulations will mean you are legally obliged to do so if you have the virus or have been asked to do so by NHS Test and Trace.”Currently people who have symptoms or test positive are asked to self-isolate for 10 days. Those who live with someone who either has symptoms or tests positive must self-isolate for 14 days.The new fines will start at £1,000 -- in line with breaking quarantine after international travel -- and rise to £10,000 for repeat offences and the worst breaches, including businesses that threaten self-isolating staff with redundancy, officials said.In an incentive to get people to comply, those on low incomes will be able to claim an extra lump sum of £500 if they are unable to work from home during their isolation.“While most people are doing their absolute level best to comply with the rules, I don’t want to see a situation where people don’t feel they are financially able to self-isolate,” Johnson said.Almost 42,000 people who have tested positive for Covid-19 have died in Britain, the worst death toll from the pandemic in Europe.After a summer lull, cases are rising rapidly again and Johnson warned on Friday of a second wave.“We are seeing it in France, in Spain, across Europe -- it has been absolutely, I’m afraid, inevitable we were going to see it in this country,” he said.New rules limiting social gatherings to six people from different households came into effect this week, and local measures have been introduced across the country.But Johnson has expressed his reluctance to introduce another nationwide lockdown and some of his Conservative lawmakers are increasingly vocal in condemning current restrictions.In London on Saturday, anti-vaccine and anti-lockdown protesters clashed with police in Trafalgar Square. Police said 32 people were arrested.
Chinese bank stocks: never this cheap, rarely so unloved.Weakened by the government’s call to sacrifice profitability, stung by ultra-low interest rates and the threat of souring loans, the country’s Hong Kong-listed banks have seen their market value contract by $194 billion in 2020 as of Wednesday. Their share of the MSCI China Index has shrunk to a measly 14%, near the lowest since 2005 and down from a 43% weighting in June 2015.Much of the recent focus has been on China’s big four state-owned lenders, which posted profit declines of at least 10% in the first half. Shares of Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., Agricultural Bank of China Ltd., Bank of China Ltd. and China Construction Bank Corp. are priced at half their estimated book value or less, the lowest on record. A gauge of Chinese banks in Hong Kong is down 24% this year, on pace for the worst slump since the global financial crisis.Chinese lenders have been a losing trade since 2018, when the government began tightening conditions in money markets as part of Xi Jinping’s deleveraging campaign. The pandemic has brought renewed pressure, with banks enlisted to funnel cheap loans to support economic growth. Bad debt hit a record this year and capital buffers are eroding so much that lenders including ICBC are planning a combined $29 billion bond sale.Shares of Chinese banks listed in Hong Kong, where valuations are typically cheaper than on the mainland, are trading near their all-time low relative to the MSCI China Index. And it could get worse: Citigroup Inc. analysts last week said investors have yet to price in the full extent of this year’s profit deterioration, predicting a 23% slump versus 2019 for the banks they cover.The value of non-performing loans may rise to as much as 3.8 trillion yuan ($556 billion) from 2.7 trillion yuan last year, the Citigroup analysts estimated.China’s perennial underperformers, bank shares have been singled out as too-cheap-too-ignore for years. Value investors keep burning their fingers: the stocks lagged a bull market in 2017, they were close to toxic in 2018 and they disappointed again in 2019.A Bloomberg index of Chinese banks in Hong Kong rose 1.9% on Tuesday, with some traders predicting a rotation into the sector from expensive industries like consumer shares. It slid as much as 1.3% before ending 0.9% lower on Wednesday, the biggest drop this month.It’s a never-ending value trap that’s once again tempting the brave. Banks have tumbled more than 7% since Zhou Liang, founder of Shanghai Minority Asset Management Co., said in June that the value case for the stocks was too compelling. And yet he says he’s buying more.“The risk-reward of Chinese bank shares is really attractive right now,” said Zhou.Like Zhou, Beijing Lingtongshengtai Asset Management’s Dong Baozhen is keeping the faith even though bank stocks have dragged his flagship fund to a 40% loss since the end of 2017. Dong started adding the shares in 2018 and hasn’t been put off by this year’s slump. “I’m upbeat on the whole sector and you can almost just close your eyes and buy any bank stock.”There’s brave and then there’s Chen Jiahe, chief investment officer of Novem Arcae Technologies Co. He has about one-third of his portfolio in the sector, mostly shares of the large state-owned banks. He’s looking to make 300% to 400% returns on his bank holdings in the next few years.“You have to have endurance,” said Chen. “As long as you’re sure of your bet, you have to be mentally prepared.”
India pacer Mohammed Shami who will turn up for Kings XI Punjab in IPL 2020, starting from September 19 in UAE turned emotional while speaking about his daughter Aira, who stays with his estranged wife Hasin Jahan.Shami said he misses his daughter a lot, whom he hasn’t met for some time due to the lockdown.“I could not meet her during the lockdown. She is growing up fast. I miss her a lot,” Shami told PTI.Shami was training at his farmhouse during the lockdown and after a practice match on Thursday, he feels everyone is regaining their rhythm.“It’s been a long time since we played cricket. Everyone is happy like kids in a candy store after getting back to the sport they love the most. We had a practice match on Thursday, I didn’t face any issues. Everyone is getting back to the rhythm. I didn’t feel much difference (as I was bowling at my farmhouse),” Shami added.Shami who had been rather subdued between 2013 and 2018 IPL, had an exceptional season in 2019, picking up 19 wickets at an average of 24.68. Shami has a total of 40 wickets in IPL — the most in the current KXIP squad.Shami further remembered the lockdown months, serving the poor migrants near his house in Sahaspur, Uttar Pradesh by setting up food distribution centres with the help of his friend Umesh.“For me, it never felt like a lockdown; it just flew away. We were busy since morning arranging food, running six kitchens and in the evening I was back at practice. I am really thankful to the administration and people who helped us,” he said.The right-arm seamer admitted that he will miss playing in front of big crowds but also added that it is the responsibility of cricketers like him to bring the smiles back in these tough times.“It feels great when people cheer us from the stadium, but in the current scenario when that is not possible, it’s our responsibility to cheer them up, people who are battling a difficult time.“We can at least do that to our fans. For one season, we can play without the crowd, I don’t think there would be an issue,” Shami added.KXIP begin their IPL 2020 campaign against Delhi Capitals on September 20 in Dubai.(With PTI inputs)
After a long discussion, the Homoeopathy Central Council (Amendment) Bill, 2020, was passed in the Rajya Sabha on Friday.Speaking on the Bill, Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan told the Upper House that the Centre is committed to ensuring that all kinds of medicines are available to the citizens. However, he objected to the use of the term “quackery” in reference to certain ancient Indian medical system.“The government is committed to ensure that all kinds of medicines are available to the citizens. We also have the National Digital Mission. New medical institutes are opening under which there are blocks dealing with Indian medicines,” he said.“A member of the House called the reform and regulation of the Indian systems of the medicine being undertaken through the bills, as promoting ‘quackery’. I am pained by the use of this word. Yoga and naturopathy need a separate national medical commission. Also, the National Medical Commission for modern medicine will be functional soon,” the Union Health Minister said.The Homoeopathy Central Council (Amendment) Bill, 2020 was introduced in Rajya Sabha on September 14, 2020. The Bill, which is now an Act, amends the Homoeopathy Central Council Act, 1973.The Act sets up the Central Council of Homoeopathy which regulates homoeopathic education and practice. The Bill replaced the Homoeopathy Central Council (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020 which was promulgated on April 24, 2020.Apart from that the Indian Medicine Central Council (Amendment) Bill, 2020 has also been passed in the Rajya Sabha.
Inaugurating the Kosi Rail Mega Bridge in Bihar on Friday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi used the platform to engage with farmers in the country and said his government is committed to providing fair prices to them through minimum support price (MSP).PM Modi congratulated the farmers on the passage of two bills related to the agriculture sector in the Lok Sabha out of which one seeks to promote barrier-free inter-state and intra-state trade in agricultural produce amid strong protests by the opposition and National Democratic Alliance (NDA) ally Shiromani Akali Dal.Here are the top 10 quotes from PM Modi’s address:* I congratulate the farmers of the country for these bills. These bills were very necessary to protect the middlemen between the farmer and the customer, who take a large part of the farmers’ earnings themselves.*At the time of elections, they talked big in order to woo the farmers, used them, put in their manifesto and forgot after the election. Today, when the BJP-NDA government is doing the same things, they are spreading all sorts of lies.* These people are forgetting how aware the country’s farmer is. They are seeing that some people do not like the new opportunities being provided to the farmers. The farmer of the country is watching those people who are standing with middlemen.* Now it is being propagated that the benefit of MSP will not be given to the farmers by the government. It is also being said that the government will not buy paddy-wheat etc. from farmers. This is a lie, its wrong, farmers are being deceived.* Our government is committed to providing fair prices to farmers through MSP. Government procurement will continue as before.* Anyone can sell his product anywhere in the world, wherever he wants. But only peasant brothers and sisters were denied this right. Now, with the new provisions in force, the farmer will be able to sell his crop in any market of the country at his desired price.* Today I want to give a clear message to the farmers of the country with humility. Do not get into any kind of confusion. Farmers of the country have to be vigilant against these people. Beware of those who ruled the country for decades and who are lying to the farmers today.* Considering the problems faced by the farmers, our government has made constant efforts to overcome every problem.* They are beating the knack of protecting the farmers, but actually they want to keep the farmers in bonds. Those people are supporting the middlemen, they are supporting the earnings of the farmers with the looters in between.* This is the need of the country and also the demand of the times. We have an obligation to empower farmers, women, youth, all in the creation of the nation. All the projects that have been started today are part of this responsibility.
Updated: Sep 14, 2020 16:42 ISTSwara Bhasker is often known to be ‘outspoken’ and not mince any words but she doesn’t think it is true. She said in a new interview that she lies at film screenings all the time and never gives a negative review to a film or performance.According to Swara, she only expresses her views on subjects that ‘are relevant to a greater, larger good’. When it comes to films and performances, she either reserves her comments or lies that she liked it.In an interview with Hrishikesh Kannan, Swara said, “I am beginning to hate this label. I don’t even know what it means. I am always lying to people at film screenings about how their film was. I do that very well. I don’t give views if I don’t feel they are relevant to a greater, larger good. I never give negative reviews to films. If I don’t like it, I don’t say anything or I lie... Because as an actor, I know the kind of work that goes into making a film and into people’s performances. Even if it has failed to achieve what it tried to do, there is an effort there that I know, because I am from that world.”Swara said she shares her opinions only on ‘things that affect us as a society’. “People think I am very critical and outspoken. I am like, you don’t know half the s**t that I am not saying! It’s a slightly tiring label to carry around now,” she said.Also see | Indoo Ki Jawani teaser: Kiara Advani film swipes right on September 16, watch videoEarlier this year, Swara voiced her dissent against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC), and even took to the streets to protest against them.Swara was seen in two web series earlier this year.

The show was at the centre of a controversy after Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) chief Prasoon Joshi raised an objection to its ‘irresponsible content’. However, she defended the show and said that he had misinterpreted a scene of a girl dancing.Swara was also seen in Eros Now series Flesh, in which she played a cop hunting human traffickers. Her next show, Bhaag Beanie Bhaag, will release on Netflix.
Updated: Sep 14, 2020 16:48 ISTKangana Ranaut has said that she will continue to get Y-plus security cover, despite leaving Mumbai on Monday morning. Brijesh Kalappa, an advocate in the Supreme Court, raised questions about the security granted to her by the Union home ministry and asked for it to be withdrawn, now that she was ‘safe’ in her home state, Himachal Pradesh.“Brijesh ji security is not given based on what you or I think, IB ( Intelligence Bureau) investigates the threat, based on the threat my security grade is decided, by the grace of God in coming days it might get totally removed or if IB report gets worse they might upgrade,” she wrote on Twitter.Kangana was replying to his tweet, which said, “Y category security for one person costs the Centre over 10,00,000/- each month. This money is borne by taxpayers. Now that Kangana is safe in HP (far away from POK), will Modi Sarkar kindly withdraw the security detail provided to her?!”On September 7, Kangana was given Y-plus security, ahead of her Mumbai visit on September 9. Earlier this month, she compared Mumbai to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and criticised the Mumbai Police, leading to sharp responses from many, including Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh and Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut.Also see | Indoo Ki Jawani teaser: Kiara Advani film swipes right on September 16, watch videoUnder her new security cover, Kangana is protected by around 10 armed commandos round-the-clock. On Monday, after safely leaving Mumbai, she tweeted in Hindi, “After landing in Chandigarh, my security has visibly decreased... People are congratulating me. It seems like I survived this time. There was a time when I felt a mother’s touch in Mumbai, but today the situation is such that I am lucky to be alive.” She further said that Mumbai is being overrun by a terrorist administration.Kangana has been taking on the ruling Maharashtra government and has been issuing challenges to the state’s chief minister, Uddhav Thackeray. She has accused him of colluding with the Bollywood ‘mafia’ against her and vowed to expose his ‘underhand’ ways.

The Trump administration on Monday shelved plans for a broad import ban on cotton and tomato products from China’s Xinjiang region while announcing narrower bans on products from five specific entities.Department of Homeland Security (DHS) acting Deputy Secretary Kenneth Cuccinelli said the new “Withhold Release Orders” (WROs) on cotton, textiles, apparel, hair products and computer parts are aimed at combating China’s use of forced labor by detained Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang.He told reporters on a conference call that the administration was conducting more legal analysis of the region-wide import bans.Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials told Reuters last week that they had prepared the broader bans on cotton, cotton textiles and tomatoes, among China’s biggest commodity exports, along with the orders announced on Monday.CBP acting Commissioner Mark Morgan said on Monday the agency’s investigations into the region-wide orders were continuing.Two people familiar with the Trump administration’s internal deliberations said that concerns about the broad orders and their effect on supply chains were raised by officials, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue.China also had agreed to buy increased quantities of U.S. cotton under the countries’ Phase 1 trade deal, which could be put at risk by a U.S. ban on imports from China’s dominant cotton-producing region.But Cuccinelli said it was legal concerns, not trade, that prompted the need for more study of the region-wide import bans.“We want to make sure that when we do get challenged - and we assume that we will be challenged, legally - that we will prevail and none of the goods we would ultimately would seize under such a WRO would be shaken loose and released into the United States,” he said.The Withhold Release Orders allow U.S. Customs and Border Protection to detain shipments based on suspicion of forced-labor involvement under long-standing U.S. laws to combat human trafficking, child labor and other human rights abuses. Shippers can send the products to other countries or seek to prove that they are not produced with forced labor.DHS said the block on products from Xinjiang entering the United States applied to all products made with labor from the Lop County No. 4 Vocational Skills Education and Training Center; hair products from the Lop County Hair Product Industrial Park; apparel produced by Yili Zhuowan Garment Manufacturing and Baoding LYSZD Trade and Business Co; Cotton produced and processed by Xinjiang Junggar Cotton and Linen Co Ltd; and computer parts made by Hefei Bitland Information Technology Co Ltd.Neither Xinjiang Junggar nor Baoding LYSZD were aware of the orders when asked on Tuesday. Yili Zhuowan declined to comment.The U.S.-based group Worker Rights Consortium said this year that Yili Zhuowan had made gloves for French brand Lacoste that appeared to have been sewn at a factory where ethnic minority people faced forced ideological and behavioral re-education.

Manchester United was well off the pace in its first Premier League game of the season Saturday, losing 3-1 at home to Crystal Palace in a match featuring a converted retaken penalty following an intervention by VAR.After a short and disjointed preseason, United’s players were sluggish throughout as Wilfried Zaha’s two second-half goals earned Palace a win at Old Trafford for a second straight season.Zaha’s first goal came from the penalty spot after the referee ordered a spot kick to be retaken because of encroachment from United goalkeeper David de Gea before he saved an attempt by Jordan Ayew. De Gea didn’t have at least one foot on the goal line as Ayew struck his shot.That made it 2-0 in the 74th minute and although Donny Van de Beek’s goal six minutes later gave United hope, Zaha shrugged off his marker before firing home Palace’s third goal in the 85th.Andros Townsend put Palace ahead in the seventh minute.United had barely a month between seasons after a late finish to the 2019-20 campaign owing to its involvement in the latter stages of the Europa League. The offseason has been troubled, too, with captain Harry Maguire getting arrested and being given a suspended 21-month sentence last month for assaulting a police officer and resisting arrest during an incident on the Greek island of Mykonos. Maguire has since filed an appeal against his conviction and will get a retrial on a date yet to be announced.Mason Greenwood has also been training alone after being dropped from the England squad for breaching coronavirus rules by meeting up with women from outside the team bubble while the national team was in Iceland.While Maguire started against Palace, Greenwood was on the bench and came on in the second half. Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Nemanja Matic were only deemed fit enough to start on the bench, too.Paul Pogba, who contracted the coronavirus in the offseason, struggled with the intensity of the game and gave possession away repeatedly in the second half.
With coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases crossing 30 million globally, the appeal of herd immunity as an end to the pandemic becomes increasingly persuasive. Yet, some countries, including India, have recently re-confirmed re-infection using genome sequencing to demonstrate that the second infection was caused by genetically distinct Sars-CoV-2 virus, which has made depending on “a nice big epidemic” – in the words of UK pandemic advisor Graham Medley – to end the public health emergency not just facetious but very stupid.Herd immunity is used to describe the indirect protection conferred to a population in which the majority of people have natural or acquired immunity to an infection. This is possible either through a large proportion of the population getting infected or vaccinated. Vaccines have made once common diseases such as polio, measles mumps, and chickenpox very rare today because the few unvaccinated people who get infected cannot spread it to the vaccinated population, which stops the spread of the disease.In an interview with HT this week, Bill Gates explained why the herd immunity strategy will not work. “Letting people get sick until most are immune and the disease no longer spreads easily will lead to many millions of deaths. The second (issue not being addressed) is that herd immunity is always temporary, because children are born without immunity, and eventually there will be enough susceptible people that the disease can start spreading easily again,” said Gates, co-chair of The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.“There is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from Covid-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection,” according to World Health Organization. “We are nowhere close to the levels of immunity required to stop this disease transmitting. We need to focus on what we can actually do now to suppress transmission and not live in hope of herd immunity being our salvation,” said Dr Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme, in August.According to a paper on ‘A history of Herd Immunity’ in The Lancet on September 19, researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health and Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US said that the phrase was first used by American veterinarian George Potter in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association in 1916, about an epidemic of spontaneous miscarriage in cattle and sheep, to describe how retaining immune cows instead of culling them can save the herd.In July, 1919, bacteriologist W W C Topley described experimental epidemics he created in groups of mice to demonstrate that unless there was a steady influx of susceptible mice, the rising prevalence of immune animals would end an epidemic. In 1922, Topley suggested a parallel between outbreaks in mice and children, saying, “Such a likeness would seem to exist in the case of epidemic diseases affecting children of school age.”Vaccines put the spotlight back on herd or population immunity in the 1960s and 1970s as public health specialists worked to achieve sufficient levels of vaccine coverage to stop disease transmission, and in the case of smallpox and polio, eradicate diseases.Only a vaccine can end the Covid-19 pandemic. “A vaccine is critical. It will save lives now and protect future generations from re-living this experience,” said Gates.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday took on critics of his government’s farm liberalisation plan, a day after the lower House passed two of the three farm bills, accusing detractors of spreading “misinformation and lies”, while reassuring farmers that the reforms were in their best interests.His comments, made in an address dedicating a railway bridge in Bihar and also on the microblogging site Twitter, came after Lok Sabha passed the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, and The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 by a majority voice vote. On Tuesday, the lower House had passed a third legislation, the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill.Also Read: ‘What politics?’: Farmers protesting against farm bills everywhere, says Harsimrat Kaur Badal after quittingThe main Opposition party, Congress, and a clutch of smaller parties have opposed the reforms. A key opposition to the bills came from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party ally, the Shiromani Akali Dal, whose minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal resigned from the Union Cabinet after her party opposed the bills, exposing a crucial rift between the two parties over efforts to unshackle the farm sector.Modi addressed farmers over concerns about prices and the country’s procurement system, under which the government buys farm produce at minimum support prices (MSP) from farmers.“People who ruled this country for decades and were in power…such people are trying to mislead farmers. They are telling lies to farmers,” Modi said.Also Read: Why farm sector reform bills are angering farmers: All you need to know“Fake news is also being spread that wheat and rice etc. will not be procured by government agencies from farmers. This is an absolute lie, completely wrong and an attempt to cheat farmers,” the Prime Minister said.A key bill, the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, allows buyers of farm produce to trade outside the mandi system or wholesale market system run by states under the agricultural produce market committees or APMCs.APMC laws require farmers to only sell to licensed middlemen in notified markets, usually in the same area where the farmers reside, rather than in open markets, which economists say scuttles price discovery, hurting farm profits. The bill enables farmers and buyers of their produce to trade outside these markets without any taxes and will therefore open up APMCs to competitions.“The reforms will give new freedom to farmers. These reforms will bring more options and opportunities for farmers to sell their produce.”Congratulating farmers of the country over passage of this bills in the lower House, Modi said the reforms would “protect farmers” from “middlemen”.“Middlemen stand between farmers and their customers; these middlemen take a big chunk of farmers’ income. These reforms have come as a protective shield for farmers.”“The agriculture sector will benefit from modern technology and our farmers will also be empowered,” the Prime Minister said in a series of tweets.किसानों को अपनी उपज देश में कहीं पर भी, किसी को भी बेचने की आजादी देना, बहुत ऐतिहासिक कदम है।21वीं सदी में भारत का किसान, बंधनों में नहीं, खुलकर खेती करेगा,जहां मन आएगा अपनी उपज बेचेगा,किसी बिचौलिए का मोहताज नहीं रहेगा औरअपनी उपज, अपनी आय भी बढ़ाएगा: PM — PMO India (@PMOIndia) September 18, 2020Critics have called for greater regulation and oversight, alleging that the reforms would replace public monopolies with private one.“Ultimately these so-called reforms are going to lead to replication of old structures outside mandis. Creating two market spaces with two completely different sets of rules is a recipe for disaster,” said Kavitha Kuruganti of the Alliance for Sustainable & Holistic Agriculture“Government will not come to know anything about transactions in these new markets. Not knowing will give the excuse not to act. Farmers fear this, rightly so,” she said.
In the ensuing years, the car saw several owners but remained in its factory-state. The original map and manuals are also present, as are the leather seats and steeAt a recent auction, therefore, it was always expected to command a hefty asking price.According to a report in UK's Daily Mail, the expected final auction price was pegged at £10 million but the final bid fell slightly short at £9.5 million. This, nonetheless, was a record and made this the most expensive Bugatti to have ever been auctioned.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday hailed the passage of agriculture bills in the Lok Sabha and slammed the Opposition for not supporting reforms that he claimed will prove to be “farmers’ shields” against middlemen.Farmers will have more opportunities to sell their produce without having to worry about middlemen and this will result in increased profits, PM Modi said in a virtual message after inaugurating Kosi rail mega bridge via video-conferencing.“Farmers have been given new independence in agriculture. They’ll now have more options and opportunities to sell their produce. I congratulate them on the passage of the bills. It was necessary to bring these to protect them from middlemen. These are farmers’ shields,” he said.Taking a swipe at those protesting against the bills, PM Modi said that many forces were trying to “mislead” farmers on this issue.“Beware of the politics of those who ruled the country for decades and did nothing to empower farmers. These people are in favour of middlemen who unfairly loot the profit of farmers,” PM Modi said.His statements came in the backdrop of protests across the country against the passage of the bills. While Congress MPs from Punjab burnt copies of the bills inside Parliament complex on Thursday, farmers of the state said they will stage a ‘rail roko’ agitation from September 24 to September 26 .Harsimrat Kaur Badal resigned as the Union minister for food processing industries in protest against the bills and her party Shiromani Akali Dal has, along with Congress, Trinamool Congress and Revolutionary Socialist Party, opposed them.The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 and The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 were passed in the Lok Sabha on Thursday. The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill was passed in the lower house on September 13.
The United Arab Emirates on Monday granted emergency approval for use of a coronavirus vaccine, six weeks after human trials in the Gulf Arab state started.A phase III trial of a Covid-19 inactivated vaccine developed by Chinese state-owned pharmaceutical company Sinopham began in the UAE in July and is yet to be completed.“The vaccine will be available to our first line of defense heroes who are at the highest risk of contracting the virus,” said the National Emergency Crisis and Disaster Management Authority in a tweet.The announcement comes amid a surge in new Covid-19 cases in the UAE, which reported 1,007 cases on Saturday, its highest since the start of the pandemic. There were 777 new cases on Monday.Emergency use of the vaccine, which is still being tested, was granted after a set criteria and after it had been tested on 31,000 volunteers, it said.Mild and expected side effects occurred but there have been no severe side effects, the agency said without specifying. It added a thousand people suffering from chronic diseases who took part saw no complications.Sinopharm secured approval for the trial in late June. The experimental vaccine passed Phases I and II of clinical trials with 100% of volunteers generating antibodies after two doses in 28 days, an Abu Dhabi government statement said in July.According to the Centers for Disease Control, inactivated vaccines - made with either inactivated (killed) viruses or with a protein from the virus - are well known and have been used against diseases such as influenza and measles.Russia in August become the first country in the world to grant regulatory approval to a coronavirus vaccine, after less than two months of human testing.
Actor Himani Shivpuri, currently battling Covid-19 in an isolation ward of a Mumbai hospital, feels people are taking the pandemic too lightly at this point. Giving her own example, she says she followed every precaution possible. “People have been mislead by these things, that recovery rate is high, mortality rate is low, and beginning to get careless. This pandemic is there, and rising at an alarming rate. One gets surprised how the hell did they get it. I am very careful, masked, use sanitiser all the time, sanitise all surfaces, even my make up room, and despite that, I still caught it. This means it’s a strong strain of virus. We have to be careful and not become complacent,” tells us the 59-year-old.Shivpuri had been shooting for a television show and an advertisement recently too. She says that the producer of her show was kind enough to extend help, “She recommended me the doctor, who helped me get a room. They went out of the way, and asked if I need money, I told them I am fine right now, but if there’s anything I would definitely tell them.”Feeling better now, the actor adds that initially, the panic sets in. “You feel you can’t be the person who has got it, I had been praying. But the way it’s spreading around… I was shooting, so one is bound to come in contact with a Covid 19 positive person. I got it, then I was admitted in the hospital. Before that temperature had been high, I was imagining all sorts of things, imagination is the worst. As soon as I entered the hospital, my oxygen saturation level came to normal,” she tells us.The rest of Shivpuri’s family is also in self isolation at their society home. The worst affected, she feels, is her pet dog. “She is just cooped inside the house because of me, as nothing from the house can go out or down. The poor dog has been trained to pee and poop outside, how can she suddenly do it inside the house? It’s torture for her. I want people to be aware, it’s been proved dogs are not Covid carriers. Other societies are allowing, ours has this weird rule, that nothing before 14 days of quarantine,” rues the actor.
Updated: Sep 14, 2020 15:48 ISTFilmmaker Anurag Kashyap had a rather funny response to a death hoax on Twitter. The tweet came from the verified account of KRK Box Office, actor-critic Kamaal R Khan’s platform for Bollywood news and trade analyses.Anurag quipped that Yamraj (the Hindu God of death) escorted him back to Earth as his existence and films gave meaning to a lot of people’s lives. He was replying to a tweet, which said, “#RIP #AnuragKashyap! He was really a great storyteller! We will always miss you sir!”“Kal Yamraj ke darshan hue… Aaj Yamraj khud ghar wapas chhod ke gaye. Bole - abhi toh aur filmein banani hai tumhe. Tum film nahi banaoge aur bewakoof/bhakt uska boycott nahi karenge, toh unka jeevan sarthak nahi hoga. Unko sarthakta mile isliye wapas chhod gaye mujhe (Met Yamraj yesterday. Today, he himself escorted me back home. He said, ‘You still have to make more films. If you don’t make films and if these films are not boycotted by idiots and bhakts, their lives will be meaningless.’ He left me back on Earth so that I can help them find meaning in their lives),” the director tweeted.कल यमराज के दर्शन हुए .. आज यमराज खुद घर वापस छोड़ के गए । बोले - अभी तो और फ़िल्में बनानी हैं तुम्हें । तुम फ़िल्म नहीं बनाओगे और बेवक़ूफ़/भक्त उसका boycott नहीं करेंगे , तो उनका जीवन सार्थक नहीं होगा। उनको सार्थकता मिले इसलिए वापस छोड़ गये मुझे। https://t.co/fHuZN6YQ5n — Anurag Kashyap (@anuragkashyap72) September 14, 2020Anurag is no stranger to being trolled online. In 2018, he told PTI that trolls simply poured out their frustration online. “We are dealing with a country which is so over-populated, where there is so much resentment, so much repression, so many mouths to feed, so many people looking for work, so many disillusioned people. Sometimes I think when they are frustrated they want to take it out. And they feel better after abusing,” he said.On the work front, Anurag began 2020 by directing a segment in the Netflix anthology Ghost Stories. He also directed Choked: Paisa Bolta Hai, which released on Netflix. Apart from this, he acted as a corrupt police officer in Ghoomketu, which starred Nawazuddin Siddiqui in the titular role.
The Adelaide Oval’s onsite hotel is set to serve as a bio-secure bubble for the Australian men’s squad ahead of the high-profile Test series against India later this year, according to media reports.Cricket Australia (CA) announced on Saturday that its national squad would return form the current tour of the UK to Adelaide for its mandatory quarantine period and preparation for the upcoming home season, including the tour by India, a report in cricket.com.au said.Those players not involved in the Indian Premier League, as well as coaching and support staff, will make the Adelaide Oval their home once the white-ball tour of England concludes following Wednesday’s third ODI in Manchester.They can train throughout their quarantine period at the new Oval Hotel based at Adelaide Oval. For Australia players like Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Starc, Marnus Labuschagne and Matthew Wade, the quarantine period at Adelaide Oval bio-secure bubble will mark the start of preparation for a Test summer against heavyweights India and potentially Afghanistan.“I can’t wait for India to come out ... that’s the pinnacle, like the Ashes,” Lyon was quoted as saying by the report in cricket.com.au. “You look at the great players India’s got, it’s going to be a massive challenge.”According to the report, CA also “remains in productive conversations with state governments regarding arrival and quarantine arrangements for the Indian team, as well as Australian players returning from the IPL in the UAE”.“We are happy that we are able to assist the Australian men’s cricket team on their return to South Australia and at Adelaide Oval in the Oval Hotel,” said SACA Chief Executive Keith Bradshaw in a CA statement.“Rest assured we have undergone rigorous procedures with Premier Steven Marshall and the SA Government, to ensure the safety of the public and the players. Our hope is that the Oval Hotel can continue to be used in the successful staging of international cricket this season.”
Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap has weighed in on the insider-outsider debate in Bollywood. Anurag said that with the advancement of OTT platforms, there are a lot more opportunities for outsiders to prove their talent.Anurag has even spoken about how Ranveer Singh suffered multiple rejections in his career, despite being dubbed an insider for his very distant connection with Anil Kapoor’s family. Anurag said that Ranveer had auditioned for Shaitan but was rejected. He even wanted to make Bombay Velvet with him but the studios threatened to back out if he did.Speaking to journalist Faye D’Souza, Anurag said, “However much people call him an insider because of some remote connection, from two generations before, the man has struggled. Ranveer Singh was rejected in an audition in Shaitan. Ranveer Singh is an actor who when I wanted to cast him in Bombay Velvet, I had a tough time. My studios and nobody believed in me and told me they will not give me money if I made the film with him. So even that Ranveer Singh, that I know two personal stories of my own production that rejected him, he is a star today.”Actor Ranbir Kapoor was ultimately brought on as the lead in Bombay Velvet opposite Anushka Sharma. The film proved to be a flop at the box office and was also widely panned by critics.Anurag also talked about how he and Kangana Ranaut had fought nepotism early in their careers. “See nepotism was a debate of 2000, the early decade. Right now, with OTT coming into the picture, that debate is pointless. There are much more opportunities on OTT, there are much more outsiders coming in. That was the time I fought that battle. When me and Kangana were friends and were like ‘We will do this film’. How many people believed in Queen? Nobody did. We went down and fought that battle. This industry was about supporting their people, like any other business,” he said.Anurag and Kangana have been at loggerheads lately for their opposing views on Bollywood’s drug abuse issue, politics, nationalism and more. Recently, when Kangana talked about she was a warrior, ready to serve her country, Anurag joked that she should fight with the troops against China. Kangana, in turn, called him a fool for not understanding her metaphor.
Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat on Friday said that 5.5 metre width of the Char Dham road project won’t work from a strategic and security point of view in the sensitive bordering areas of the state.Rawat, while addressing a query about the Char Dham road project during a press conference in Dehradun on the completion of three and a half years of his government, said “5.5 metre road width se kaam nahi chalega. (5.5 m road width won’t work).Stressing upon the need to have a wider road in the strategically important border areas, Rawat said he will urge the Central government to look into this matter.“When we take border security aspect into consideration, widening of the Char Dham road is required,” he said.The all-weather road project aims to connect the four shrines of Kedarnath, Badrinath, Gangotri and Yamunotri through an 826km long road.Darshan Singh Rawat, media coordinator for CM Rawat, said the chief minister will be soon writing to the Centre on the necessity for a wider Char Dham road from a strategic point of view and for improving connectivity in areas bordering China in the state.The official, however, added that the state government can’t file a special leave petition in the Supreme Court on the matter since the Central government and the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) are directly dealing with the matter.On September 8, 2020, the Supreme Court had ordered that the ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) circular of 2018 is to be followed for Char Dham road construction. The MoRTH circular says that the roads in the hilly and mountain terrains are to be of 5.5 m width (18 ft) with two-lane structures (23 ft).Also Read: On China, India is making a mistake | OpinionThe apex court had upheld the views of Ravi Chopra, chairman of the Supreme Court (SC) appointed high powered committee (HPC) on Char Dham road project which recommended 5.5 m intermediate road width against the view in support of 12 m total road width-- submitted by the majority group of the HPC-- in tune with the 2012 circular of the MoRTH.In August last year, the Supreme Court had ordered the formation of an 11-member high-powered committee to “consider the cumulative and independent impact of the Char Dham project on the entire Himalayan valleys…”Also Watch: India’s ‘Island Gambit’ against China?

A review meeting with the union road and transport minister was held on July 17 this year on the progress of the road project costing Rs 12,072 crore.It was then informed that over 350 km of the road network has been constructed so far as part of the project.

‘Thappad se darr nahi lagta sahab, pyaar se lagta hai’ — this punchline not only became her trademark, but also ensured that Sonakshi Sinha becomes a household name across the country. The year was 2010, when her debut film Dabangg, opposite Salman Khan hit the theatres. And what it did for her and Khan both, was something unprecedented. And here she is today, talking to us about the past 10 years.To begin with, she wasn’t even interested in a career in films! Sinha tells us, “Life before my debut was actually going in a different direction. I was studying fashion designing, and was happy, until Salman and Arbaaz (actor, producer of Dabangg) spotted me, and felt I would fit the role of Rajjo perfectly. They were coming out with this film based in the heartland, and wanted an Indian looking girl and launch someone new. I wasn’t asked if I want to do the film, I was told! (laughs) I just felt at that point of time, the Universe was throwing something at me, a big opportunity, and I should take it. I did.”The 33-year-old goes on to confess that it was while shooting Dabangg that she realised she enjoys this. Otherwise, even as someone whose dad (Shatrughan Sinha) was an actor, she didn’t visit his film sets. “I realised this is what I want to continue doing for the rest of my life. I started loving being on set. I barely visited my dad’s film sets when I was a child, so I was never inclined towards it. When I started going myself, I was drawn to it. After Dabangg, it took a while for it to sink that it has released and become such a big hit. People suddenly started recognising me on streets, calling out my name. I would go to cricket matches and people would say ‘you are the Dabangg girl’. I am a very low-key person, so even though I have seen my dad see it, I never experienced this in a way like that.”Her decade-old career has been like a roller coaster ride — it’s had a lot of ups, but some downs too. However, Sinha doesn’t sweat it, and appreciates both. “I read this somewhere, that if your graph was flat, that means you are dead! You have to have both highs and lows in your life, that applies to each and every person who has been in our industry, or any other business, It’s a part of life, and not anything to do with just our industry. The only way to stay sane is to treat success and failure in the same way,” says the actor.Giving examples, she says she has seen both crore club films and those which didn’t garner numbers, “Whenever there’s been a 100-crore film, you don’t see me screaming from the rooftops ‘my film was super duper hit’, and if it doesn’t do well, I won’t go into a shell and cry about it, I’ll focus on what’s next. I treat my next film like my first one. It keeps me going.”Finally asked if it has sunk in yet that it’s been 10 long years already, and Sinha laughs, “It feels like they just flew by. It feels I just made my debut yesterday. I have enjoyed the work I did, and so much of it non-stop. I worked with such amazing people, had lovely and bad experiences. I am thankful for everything, I wouldn’t change a thing. I don’t even want to sit and think where the last 10 years went, I look forward to all good things coming my way, because I want to make sure I work harder and not get complacent.”Interact with the author on Twitter/ @RishabhSuri02

Updated: Sep 12, 2020 18:59 ISTThe crisis in South African cricket deepened with five former employees of the sport’s governing body in the country accusing it of being “unfair and unlawful”.They made the accusations in a six-page letter to the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (SASCOC), which has asked Cricket South Africa’s board to step aside as it investigates “many instances of maladministration and malpractice” in the organisation.The five person in question are former head of sales and marketing Clive Eksteen, former chief operating officer Nassei Appiah, ex-senior manager of finance Ziyanda Nkuta, former manager for procurement Lundi Maja and Appiah’s former personal assistant, Dalene Nolan.“Our concern is that Cricket South Africa has, through various officials, misled and continues to mislead Parliament, the Minister of Sports, Arts and Culture and the public,” they said in the letter, according to www.iol.co.za.“By so doing, Cricket South Africa has created a narrative that the organisation’s woes are the results of irresponsible stakeholder and financial management for which we were suspended and in most cases dismissed.” While Appiah was the last to be sacked, in August, Eksteen, too, was fired this year in June and the three others were shown the door last December.“The organisation seeks to paint a picture whereby it appears to have dealt with the problem by our expulsion and to assure all interested parties that this was done in keeping with good governance, natural justice and the law of the land.“This cannot be further from the truth as Cricket South Africa has been underhanded in its dealing with us by completely abandoning any ethics that demand that a disciplinary hearing is conducted in a manner that is lawful, procedurally fair and in the best interest of the organisation and the sport.” The CSA has been left with no one to run the daily affairs after SASCOC asked the board to step aside.CSA has been in the middle of administrative chaos for last two years and is currently also facing allegations of corruption and racial discrimination.CSA’ former chief executive officer Thabang Monroe was fired last month following the findings of a forensic report that revealed “acts of serious misconduct”.Acting CEO Jacques Faul and president Chris Nenzani resigned last month with Kugandrie Govender replacing Faul.The country’s elite players have also criticised CSA for postponing its AGM scheduled for September 5.
Harsimrat Kaur Badal, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader who stepped down as the Union food processing minister on Thursday night, said on Friday farmers all across India are protesting against the three bills seeking to liberalise agricultural markets.Harsimrat Kaur Badal had on Thursday resigned from the Union Cabinet in protest against three “anti-farmer” ordinances and legislation, which were approved by the Lok Sabha amid opposition protests.“I said the government should bring the bills after consultation with stakeholders. What is politics in this? Farmers are agitating not only in Punjab but also in Haryana, Rajasthan, UP, Maharashtra. There is opposition in south India,” Harsimrat Kaur Badal was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.President Ram Nath Kovind accepted her resignation from the Union Cabinet and directed that Narendra Singh Tomar be assigned the additional charge of the ministry, according to a press release.The SAD had been asking the Centre not to go ahead with the three agriculture-related bills for approval of Parliament “until all reservations expressed by farmers’ organisations, farmers and farm labourers” are addressed.Though the new measures, which are aimed at freeing up farm trade from restrictions, at guaranteeing a legal framework for pre-agreed prices, and at laying down a new architecture for contract farming, have been hailed by economists, farmer groups fear that they will lead to exploitation by big food-trading monopolies.“I have resigned from Union Cabinet in protest against anti-farmer ordinances and legislation. Proud to stand with farmers as their daughter and sister,” Harsimrat Kaur Badal wrote in a Twitter message.Before her comment, the chief of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s Punjab unit said Harsimrat Kaur Badal’s resignation was the “political decision” of the Shiromani Akali Dal. Ashwani Sharma said the three bills brought by the BJP-led Centre are in the interest of the farming community. He said these three bills would “surely play an important role in boosting farm income”.“Akali Dal is a part of the NDA but it is a separate political outfit. They have taken this decision because of some political reasons. We have an alliance (SAD-BJP) but both are different political outfits. They (SAD) have taken a political decision,” Sharma said, according to PTI.He added that the SAD had said they are part of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) when he was asked about the continuation of the alliance between the parties.SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal had said in Delhi on Thursday that his party’s future course of action and whether to stay in the BJP-led alliance or not will be decided in a party meeting later.
The Supreme Court (SC) on Tuesday dismissed a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking deregulation of petrol and diesel prices and to pass on to the public, the benefits of fall in international crude oil rates.The petition filed by a Kerala-based advocate, Shaji J Kodankandath, said that oil marketing companies (OMCs), which are directly under the operational control of the central government, were increasing petrol and diesel prices on a daily basis even though international crude oil prices have been at an all-time low since April.“Do you seriously want to argue this? If you do, we will impose costs,” said Justice Rohinton Nariman who was heading the bench.The petitioner’s lawyer chose not to pursue the case and accepted that the matter fell within the ambit of the government’s policy decision.The petitioner had highlighted that the current price of crude oil was hovering at around Rs 38 per barrel and the total cost of manufacturing and selling of petrol and diesel would be around Rs 30 per litre.Despite that, petrol and diesel prices are over Rs 80, which is over 150 percent more than the manufacturing cost, the plea said.“The price of diesel, which is traditionally lower than petrol, has increased. Diesel costs more than petrol in some cities for the first time in recent history,” the petition added.
Independence — his goal of decades — was round the corner. As was Partition, an anathema. But the mayhem and murder, presaging those two events, were all around him when, late in the night of November 6, 1946 , Mahatma Gandhi reached Chandpur by ferry. He was to stay a full four months in the stream-washed wetlands of Noakhali, East Bengal, heeding to calls from brutalised Hindus.No sooner did he reach that first stop in the tour came news of Muslims in Bihar having been counter-attacked, mercilessly. Grieved and ashamed, Gandhi said, “The Independence of India is today at stake in Bengal and Bihar. Biharis have behaved as cowards. If the Biharis wanted to retaliate they could have gone to Noakhali and died to a man”.Two deputations met him the next day — the first, Muslim, maintaining that no disturbances had taken place at Chandpur and the second, Hindu, seeking police and military protection. Addressing a gathering of some 15,000, mainly Muslims, at Chandpur that evening, he said, “ I have heard of forcible conversions, forcible feeding of beef, abductions and forcible marriages, not to talk about murders, arson and loot. People have broken idols. Muslims do not worship idols. Neither do I. But why should they interfere with those who wish to worship them? These incidents are a blot on the name of Islam.”The fires having been doused, if not extinguished, in East Bengal , he left on March 3, 1947 to the “opposite theatre” — Bihar. In the village of Bir, he learnt of the brutalities visited on innocent Muslims. Speaking to a gathering in that village, he could barely control his fury. “I wish to ask you, how could you live to see an old woman of 110 butchered before your eyes ? I will not rest nor let others rest. I will wander all over on foot and ask the skeletons what happened. There is such a fire raging in me that I will know no peace till I have found a solution for all this .”As steps towards the transfer of power to the two dominions began taking final shape, Gandhi remained firmly away from all of that. His feet took him where his heart said he should be — among the victims of the trauma surrounding the change. And, in early August, he went back to Bengal from Bihar. His specific intention was to return to the still-smarting Noakhali.In Calcutta, a big Muslim delegation urged him to stay on in the city to help quell the riot-like situation there. He agreed on two conditions: One, those Muslims in Calcutta urging him to work for peace in the city must do what they can to ensure the safety of Hindus in Noakhali. Two, he would live in a Muslim locality in the city where Hindus must ensure the safety of its Muslim residents.Hydari Manzil in the Beliaghata suburb of Calcutta was identified.“It was a very shabby house,” Manu Gandhi records, “without any sort of facility…open on all sides…only one latrine…every inch of the place covered with dust and muddied by rain…Only one available room where everybody and everything had to be accommodated including Bapu himself…”An officer of the information department met him on August 9 and asked him for a message to the nation on August 15. Gandhi declined to give one. The officer persisted, “It will look kharab if you do not”. Gandhi replied, “Hai nahin koyi message, hone do kharab (There is no message, let it be kharab).”On August 14, there was a change in atmosphere — for the better, it seemed. This day being his last in office, premier HS Suhrawardy sought and got the privilege of driving Gandhi around parts of the city to see the eager anticipation of Independence, the departure of the last British governor, the induction of the first Indian governor and the Congress government headed by PC Ghosh.And then a message did come. It was in the shape of a reflection. “Tomorrow we will be free from bondage to the British, but from midnight tonight Hindustan will be broken into two pieces. So tomorrow will be both a day of rejoicing and mourning”.For him, August 15 1947 was a day to fast. Too much was gnawing at his heart. And he recalled his son-like secretary Mahadev Desai who had died on that day, in 1942. Thousands flocked to his Beliaghata room. These included the new ministers to whom he said : “Do not fall prey to lure of wealth”.On the next day, August 16, 1947 John Kellas, principal of Scottish Church College asked him, “What is the relation between a nation and religion?”Witness to mutual slaughter in the name of religion, devotee of Rama who believed Ishvara and Allah were two names for the same, Gandhi gave a reply that echoes, re-echoes with a new urgency today. “A nation does not belong to any particular religion or sect. It should be absolutely independent of either.”Gopalkrishna Gandhi is a former administrator, diplomat and governorThe views expressed are personal
Updated: Sep 14, 2020 22:38 ISTKangana Ranaut seemed to have fallen for a story on a satirical news website, The Fauxy, which said that Facebook has launched a new feature to mark yourself safe from ‘Shiv Sena goons’. She shared the article on her Twitter page and thanked the social networking site for being ‘considerate’ and respecting her right to ‘free speech’.“Thank you Facebook free speech must be protected in a democracy, people need to be protected from Sonia Sena goons much like COVID -19 virus, thank you for being considerate, well done,” she tweeted.Several people felt that Kangana believed the satirical piece to be an actual news story. However, she claimed in later tweets that her post was ‘intended for sarcasm and satire’. She wrote, “The news I have tagged it’s account clearly says it’s a fictitious news source. Intended for sarcasm and satire ...” She added in another tweet, “All dimwits getting excited ... sit down pls ...”The story was done by a satirical news website, The Fauxy. Their website contains a disclaimer which says, “The Fauxy is a Satire Web Portal. The content of this website is a work of fiction. Readers are advised not to confuse the articles of The Fauxy as genuine and true.”Kangana has been engaged in a war of words with Shiv Sena leaders ever since she likened Mumbai to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and criticised the Mumbai Police earlier this month. She has been slamming Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, who is also the president of the Shiv Sena, in her tweets.Amid her verbal duel with the Maharashtra government, Kangana came to Mumbai on September 9 and challenged her detractors to stop her from entering the city. She was given Y-plus security by the Union home ministry ahead of her visit.Upon landing in Mumbai, Kangana sent out a message to the Maharashtra chief minister, accusing him of colluding with the ‘mafia’ in Bollywood to target her. She also challenged him to come at her in further tweets, vowing to ‘expose’ him and the ‘Karan Johar gang’.A few hours ago, Kangana implied that Uddhav is shielding the ‘murderers’ of Sushant Singh Rajput and people involved in the alleged drugs nexus in Bollywood. She tweeted, “Basic problem of Maharashtra CM is why I exposed movie mafia, murderers of SSR and its drug racket, who his beloved son Aaditya Thakeray hangs out with, this is my big crime so now they want to fix me, ok try let’s see who fixes who!!!”Kangana returned to her hometown on Monday morning. “With a heavy heart leaving Mumbai, the way I was terrorised all these days constant attacks and abuses hurled at me attempts to break my house after my work place, alert security with lethal weapons around me, must say my analogy about POK was bang on,” she wrote before getting on the flight.

Several ministers demanded the restoration of the Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS) funds even as two legislations to reduce the salary and allowances of Union ministers and Members of Parliament (MP) were passed in Rajya Sabha on Friday.Parliament Affairs minister Prahlad Joshi moved the Bill to amend the Salary, Allowances and Pension of Members of Parliament Act, 1954, while Minister of State for Home G Kishan Reddy moved the Salaries and Allowances of Ministers (Amendment) Bill, 2020.Also Read: ‘What politics?’: Farmers protesting against farm bills everywhere, says Harsimrat Kaur Badal after quittingBoth the bills aim to reduce the salaries and emoluments of ministers and MPs in view of the resource crunch because of Covid-19, and were passed with a voice vote.Earlier, several members of Parliament questioned the government’s decision to do away with MPLADS funds for two years, saying these were funds spent on the needs of the people, especially for local demands which would otherwise be ignored.Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad (Cong) said it was credit-worthy that members of Parliament were willing to take a salary cut even though a majority of them were solely dependent on their pay.Also Read: Parliament monsoon session: What to expect todayHe, however, added that MPLADS was a fund that belonged to the people. If MPLADS had to be curtailed, it could have been for a period lesser than two years, Azad said. “I would request that... it (MPLADS) should be done away with only for one year, and that too only half of it, and the rest should be provided to the MPs,” Azad said.Manoj Kumar Jha (RJD) said the central vista project appeared like a luxury at this time of severe resource crunch and added that the new parliament building in the offing should be put on hold as should the governments ad-spend.YSRCP member V Vijaisai Reddy had another suggestion—to cut the salaries of and penalise members who disrupt the House.Joshi said MPLADS funds or the central vista were not within the scope of the bill.
The OTT platforms have gained prominence more than ever before amid the pandemic as several films with big star cast, originally slated for theatrical releases, have been beelining to get a digital releases. While Akshay Oberoi is all for OTTs being a favoured medium, he hopes it does not become driven by big names like in the world of theatrical films.“That would not be ideal. When a film releases in theatres, we often hear people say that ‘Oh itni mehengi picture, itne bade naam hain, par bekaar hai.’ There are a whole lot of things that can go wrong when you are in this star system. Recently, a prominent producer who is a close friend told me something that people have made project in the past thinking Hrithik ki dates khaali hain, uske liye picture likho,” Oberoi shares.The 35-year-old says the best part about the OTT platforms is that people are writing and casting authentic people. “There is not name no PR image that is taken into consideration while casting. The audience is also attracted to this. It would be damaging to get star system on OTT platforms. It will spoil what good is coming from them,” he says adding, “but you never know because at the end of the day everyone is trying to make business out of it.”However, Oberoi, who has starred in a number of OTT projects including It’s Not That Simple, Bar Code, The Test Case, Selection Day and the latest Flesh, is hopeful.“So far it has all been good. The OTT actors are good and not concerned with the game of stardom,” the Gurgaon (2016) actor.While he is someone who embraced the digital platform way back in 2015, Oberoi is surprised to see how quickly it has penetrated the lives of people, especially in the past 6 months amid the pandemic.“I knew that OTT was the future when I started doing it but Covid has accelerated that process. I am so glad I joined the platform early. I didn’t know that Itni jaldi cheezein turn ho jaayengi I think the silver lining of coronavirus is that people have realized the significance and comfort of consuming content is online. Now the number of people are watching content online is so huge, even cinemas don’t get that kind of numbers,” he concludes.
In a year ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic, it is perhaps fitting that the first major full-length feature documentary examining the outbreak is set in Wuhan, the Chinese city that was the first epicentre of the international crisis.76 Days, a 93-minute film that shows powerful footage of the chaos and panic inside Wuhan in the initial days of the outbreak when the unknown virus had just begun to wreak havoc, had its world premiere at the ongoing Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF). The documentary spans the period from January 23 to April 8 this year when Wuhan, a city of 11 million people in Hubei province, was placed under a lockdown following the coronavirus outbreak.The film was made by Hao Wu, a New York-based Chinese director, who collaborated with two China-based reporters as co-directors – Weixi Chen and another associate identified only as “Anonymous”.With the Chinese government reportedly trying to conceal its failure to have warned the world of the onset of the snowballing health crisis, the film’s creators requested the first viewers at the TIFF to “refrain from discussing identifying details contained in the film” so as to “avoid any potential government interference with the film, and with the filmmakers in China, before the film’s wider release”.The film’s production notes say, “China is imposing strict controls over the narrative of its Covid-19 response, and the footage contained in this film is unprecedented in its access.”The film shows doctors, nurses and paramedics striving to control a torrent of patients pouring into hospitals even as health authorities seek to downplay the outbreak with repeated calls of: “Don’t panic.”The documentary starts with the wailing of a woman who wants to see her dead father’s corpse once last time, and shows a box in which ID cards and phones of the dead are placed.Hao, the filmmaker, recalled spending the Chinese New Year holidays in Shanghai as “a panic was setting in all over China”, adding, “It became increasingly clear that the local government had lied and suppressed whistleblowers to conceal the outbreak. It also became apparent that the situation was dire in Wuhan - people were dying, hospitals were overwhelmed, and medical personnel did not have adequate protection, so they too were getting sick and dying. The country was angry. I was angry.”The filmmaker’s teammates filmed in four hospitals and shared the raw footage online with Hao, who then took it forward.The film that was eventually put together underlines human suffering at the hands of a deadly and unknown virus as well as the heroism of medical personnel struggling to save lives in a dystopian backdrop of an escalating health crisis.The TIFF’s artistic director Cameron Bailey described the film as “urgent, powerful filmmaking”.Hao said his team members “risked their own lives to film in the hospitals, especially when the danger of the coronavirus was little understood in the early days of the Wuhan lockdown”.Hao’s co-directors entered the containment zone donning protective gear that resembled space suits. At one point, they feared for their safety and the project had to be halted when China began cracking down on non-official information being released from the country. However, after Wuhan’s lockdown was lifted, they were persuaded to return to ground zero.
After facing closure for five months in wake of Covid-19 pandemic, city-based schools are gearing up to reopen from September 21 following the state home department’s order under Unlock 4.0.Principal secretary education Sanjay Kumar clarified that as per MHA guidelines, all schools, colleges and coaching institutes will remain closed till September 30.Patna district magistrate Kumar Ravi has permitted schools outside containment zones for calling students of Class 9 to 12 who voluntarily wish to visit schools for seeking academic guidance with a written consent of their guardians from September 21.The ministry of health and family welfare on Tuesday issued standard operating procedures (SOPs) including staggering of the classrooms, no sharing of objects, separate timing slots, physical distancing and sanitisation of premises for phased reopening of schools.Meanwhile, several city schools and their management were busy on Wednesday to chalk out plan for partial reopening—for the first time after pandemic—and implementing precautionary measures.CBSE’s city coordinator Rajiv Ranjan Sinha, who is also the principal of Baldwin Academy, said, “We have arranged for thermal screening of students at entrance gate. Teachers and other staff will have to undergo training to maintain 6 feet distance during interaction. Since students will visit school after a long time, they may feel like hugging or coming close to their classmates out of excitement. Teachers have been asked to monitor students and prevent them from coming in physical contact or share objects, lunch etc.”He said, “School campus, classroom, common touch surface will be thoroughly sanitised a day prior to reopening. Seating arrangements maintain a proper gap will be made. Stock of fresh masks will be kept so that it can be provided to students in case of tear or any damage to their mask.”“Reopening of school was much needed to compensate academic loss. The students who are going to appear in board exams need proper guidance. Despite online classes, physical classroom teaching is required for better performance”, added Sinha.Similarly, Principal of St. Michael’s High School, Fr Armstrong Edison, said, “We will thoroughly sanitise the campus before calling students. Our school has been made exam centre for NEET, so staff training for handling crowd is going-on. This training will also help during partial reopening.”About how many students will be allowed to visit school in a single day, Edison said, “It’s uncertain to predict how many students wish to visit school. After consulting students, a roster will be prepared keeping SOPs in mind.”Parents in the city evoked mixed response for sending their wards to school.Rupali Singh, whose daughter studies in Class 9, said, “I am yet to gain confidence. What if school fails to implement precautionary measures? Children often remove mask when they feel suffocated.”Kamlesh Gupta, whose son studies in Class 10, said, “Online teaching is not suitable for every subject like mathematics. Combination of online class and offline doubt-clearance class would yield better results. Already six months of the current academic session has passed. In the absence of proper guidance, academic performance of students is likely to be impacted.”All educational institutions in the state have been closed since mid-March due to nationwide lockdown.
Actor Manoj Bajpayee has dismissed Kangana Ranaut’s recent comments comparing Mumbai to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, and suggesting that 99% of the film industry has been exposed to drugs. The actor recently appeared in a rap video directed by Anubhav Sinha, in which they shed light on the lives of migrant workers who seek better opportunities in big cities, particularly Mumbai.“Mumbai is a magical city. There’s magic here. Look at where I come from. Who am I? Where do I come from? People like me have made our villages, our districts, our towns, our friends and families proud. How? Because Mumbai brought magic to our lives,” he said, scoffing at the idea that anyone could disrespect it. He was asked for his reaction to comments made by ‘certain people’ in recent days.The actor added, in an interview to India Today, “We were given opportunities. And all of it happened because of Mumbai and the film industry.”Kangana in recent weeks has been involved in several spats because of her comments on Mumbai and the film industry. Claiming that she feels unsafe in Mumbai, she had compared the city to PoK. This angered Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut, who wrote an editorial condemning these comments in Saamana, the party mouthpiece, and advised her to stay away from the city.To prove a point, Kangana flew down to Mumbai from Manali, a day after the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation partially demolished her property. The actor alleged that the move was politically motivated. She wrote on Twitter while departing a few days later, “With a heavy heart leaving Mumbai, the way I was terrorised all these days constant attacks and abuses hurled at me attempts to break my house after my workplace, alert security with lethal weapons around me, must say my analogy about POK was bang on.”This week, Kangana was called out by Jaya Bachchan, who said that by criticising Mumbai, Kangana was biting the hand that feeds.
China has locked down a city on the border with Myanmar and ordered all its residents to be tested for Covid-19 after a number of people infected with the coronavirus illegally entered the city from the neighbouring country.Official media reported that “wartime” anti-epidemic measures have been put in place in Ruili city with over 200,000 people in southwest China’s Yunnan province after three coronavirus infections were detected.All Ruili residents have been directed to stay indoors as local authorities are expected to start mass nucleic acid tests for them.Screening for illegal immigrants from Myanmar will be carried out in communities, shops, restaurants and construction sites.Transport connections have been snapped and residents have been ordered not to leave the city until further notice. Outsiders are not being allowed inside city limits.Trade and businesses, except those dealing in essential services such as pharmacies and food markets, have been closed.The infections travelled from Myanmar and Chinese authorities would “crack down on illegal immigrants”, local officials said late on Monday.Besides Ruili, at least eight border prefectures and 25 border counties in the province should enter wartime status immediately, enhancing anti-epidemic measures and border management to prevent imported cases, local officials were quoted as saying by official media.Chinese media reports said authorities were mobilising residents to report “any illegal border crossings in a timely manner, stating that assistance in any form, including the provision of shelter for illegal trespassers, is strictly prohibited”.News agency AFP quoted Yang Bianqiang, vice mayor of Ruili, as saying that the city would repatriate those who cannot verify their time of arrival into China, referring to people who “have no fixed residence and have no fixed place to work”.Beijing had shut a border crossing with Myanmar in April after infighting in the country had spilled over into a Chinese province.Myanmar is a vital part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative. It was the last country that Chinese President Xi Jinping had visited, in the third week of January, before the Covid-19 outbreak all but shut international travel out of China.China has largely controlled the Covid-19 pandemic in the country except a number of localised outbreaks, including in Beijing, in recent months.The coronavirus first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan last year, before triggering the pandemic and affecting economies around the world.As of Monday, the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases on the mainland reached 85,202. Altogether, 80,426 people have been discharged and 4,634 have died from the disease on the mainland, the national health commission said in its daily update on Tuesday.Eight new imported Covid-19 cases were reported on Monday, taking the total number of imported infections to 2,653.
The changes brought about by the pandemic have significantly altered the contours of higher education. Suneel Galgotia, Chancellor, Galgotias University, shares insights on how to manage the triggers brought about by changing circumstances. Edited excerpts:How would you describe the current status of higher education in India? What are your views on the NEP 2020?I believe that the Indian higher education has seen a sea change with the government introducing the landmark NEP 2020. The New Education Policy, which is truly a much needed structural reform, is quiet commendable and has taken every step to achieve the holistic goal of providing quality education there by giving our country a skillful, talented, and professional youth population.Learning systems like online learning and digital courses are also being encouraged to accentuate the digital India initiative and the concept of continuous assessments will encourage the process of learning creatively and imaginatively.India will be promoted as a global study destination providing premium education at affordable costs which will bring a big boost to the Indian economy. The emphasis given to multi-disciplinary research will give way to high quality teaching and research along with choice to student to follow his passion in doing what he aspires and loves the most. This makes the policy is definitely student centric. One of the biggest transformational features of the new policy is the use of mother tongue as a medium of instruction at the primary level.The top 20 countries in terms of GDP all use their mother tongue as a medium of education in imparting and dissemination of knowledge.Another important addition is the introduction of coding from class VI onwards will develop a strong foundation and build logical and analytical skills among our students.Tell us about the strengths of Galgotias University.I strongly feel that the biggest strength of our Institution are our brilliant and highly innovative students who are excelling in their chosen career path.

Of the 12,000 students, who have registered to appear in the second phase of Delhi University’s open-book exams (OBE), only 3,000 will take the exams physically, officials said.The exams are scheduled to begin from September 14According to the DU’s officiating dean (examination) DS Rawat, of around 12,000 registered students,10,000 are from the School of Open Learning (SoL) and around 2,000 are those enrolled in colleges and Non-Collegiate Women’s Education Board (NCWEB). “Only around 3,000 of these students have opted for physical exams, the rest of them will write the exam online,” he said.DU will conduct the second phase of the open-book exams for those final year undergraduate and postgraduate students who could not appear in the first phase, which was held online between August 10 and 31. This time, the students have been given the option to either write the exam online or visit the university’s examination centres to take the tests.According to the University’s examination branch, as many as 2,53,677 final year undergraduate and postgraduate students were to appear in the OBE exams this year. Of them, around 2,12,256 had appeared in the first phase of OBE, as per the data submitted by the university in the Delhi High Court on August 26.DU dean of colleges and director of SoL Balaram Pani said that the majority of the students who did not apply for the second phase are from SoL. “It happens every year. Thousands of SoL students do not appear in exams. Majority of them are working. It’s just that it’s the first time that data is being analysed,” he said.While colleges and students cite the prevailing pandemic as the reason behind maximum students opting for the online mode, university officials say it’s because of the “success” of the first phase of online OBE”.In majority of DU colleges, only a handful of students have opted to appear physically. In Miranda House, only 16 students have applied for the second phase of OBE. “Only three out of them have decided to appear in exams physically. Even out of five visually impaired students we have, only two will appear in offline exams,” said college principal Bijayalaxmi Nanda.In Ramjas College, only three of the 34 students who have registered for the exams will appear physically. Similarly, in Atma Ram Sanatan Dharma College (ARSD) college only eight students will appear physically.Among the colleges where no student has chosen the physical mode are Shri Ram College of Commerce (SCRCC) and Aryabhatta College. SRCC principal Simrit Kaur said only six students, including one postgraduate student, are appearing in the second phase and none of them has applied for offline mode. “All other students of our college had successfully appeared in the first phase of exams held online,” she said.Aryabhatta principal Manoj Sinha said, “Despite colleges being ready with all precautions, there is an overall atmosphere of fear due to the pandemic. The cases are rising in Delhi and other neighbouring states. Therefore, students are opting for the online mode in the second phase as well.”Deepak Gupta, a visually challenged final year MA (English) student, has travelled from Bihar’s Rohtas district to appear in exams. But he has still chosen the online mode. “It’s not that we like online mode for appearing in exams. We have opted for it because of the prevailing situation. I did not have scribes, proper internet facility and assistive devices in my village and that’s why I have travelled to Delhi,” he said.
The Indian economy is the worst-hit among major economies, American brokerage Goldman Sachs said on Tuesday sharply cutting its 2020-21 GDP forecast to a contraction of 14.8 per cent.It had earlier estimated that the economy of the country, which is now home to the second-largest number of Covid-19 infections, to contract by 11.8 per cent.The estimate comes days after official data said the economy contracted by 23.9 per cent for the June 2020 quarter, compared to the level it was at in the year-ago period as activity across all sectors barring agriculture contracted due to the lockdowns. The nearly two-month-long lockdowns chilled economy activity but was unable to contain the number of infections, which stands at 40 lakh.“India’s GDP (gross domestic product) hit from Covid-19, the highest across major economies,” the analysts at the brokerage said.They now believe that the economy will contract 13.7 per cent for the September 2020 quarter and 9.8 per cent for the December 2020 quarter, as against the 10.7 per cent and 6.7 per cent contractions, respectively, estimated earlier.“Our estimates imply that real GDP falls by 11.1 per cent in 2020, and by 14.8 per cent in FY21,” they added.The 14.8 per cent contraction in 2020-21 is among the most pessimistic one among all the analysts till now.Earlier in the day, analysts at India Ratings and Research revised down their estimate to an 11.8 per cent contraction for 2020-21, while economists at largest lender SBI are now expecting a 10.9 per cent contraction.Like other analysts, the brokerage said there will be a sharp rebound in 2021-22 because of the low base and estimated the GDP to clock a 15.7 per cent growth in the next fiscal year.Assuming 70 per cent of the lost output in June 2020 is recovered in June 2021, they are expecting a real GDP growth of 27.1 per cent in the April-June 2021 quarter.
Former Pakistan pacer Shoaib Akhtar has once again spoken highly of Virat Kohli, saying the India captain’s growth as a batsman over the years has been terrific. Akhtar recalled the first few years of Kohli in international cricket, calling him a ‘brat’, but admitted the tremendous transformation shown by him, coupled by backing of the team management, deserves praise.Also Read | Munaf Patel, Chris Gayle, Shahid Afridi among overseas players for Lanka Premier League auction“Virat Kohli has reached a whole new level, but who is behind the Kohli brand? In 2010, 2011, Kohli was nowhere to be seen. He was part of the circle; he was a brat like me. All of a sudden, the system supported him. The management went around him. He also realised that there’s a lot of reputation at stake,” Akhtar said on a YouTube Show Cricket Baaz.Also Read | Virat Kohli goes ballistic during RCB nets, admits ‘shoulders are sore’Akhtar weighed in on Kohli’s comparison with Sachin Tendulkar, believing the Indian captain has played his cricket in a much easy era, although the former quick mentioned that it takes nothing away from what he’s achieved in his career. Kohli is India’s highest ODI run-getter and century-maker after Tendulkar, and is the leading T20I run-getter in the world with 2794 runs.“It’s not his fault that he’s playing in an era of easy cricket, or if Sachin played in a tougher era or Wasim, Waqar and Inzamam have player a much more competitive brand of cricket. So if he’s scoring runs, what we can say about it?” Akhtar said.Recently, Akhtar has been at the receiving end of criticism of his repeated praise for India, and continuous bashing of Pakistan cricket. On the topic Akhtar explained that even though there are times he criticizes the Indian cricket team too, the fact that they have two of the best batsmen in the world in Kohli and Rohit Sharma, doesn’t leave him with enough ammunition to fire at them.“I criticize India as well. But if Virat Kohli has 12,000 runs, what else you can say, Rohit Sharma has two double centuries in One Day cricket, what can you say. The enemy’s qualities should be known among us. Kohli has become the greatest batsman, what can you say, should I say he is a bad person or he is not a good player,” Akhtar said.
Startups and innovators that can offer technology solutions in response to needs arising in a post Covid-19 world will be groomed by the central government’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology’s (MeitY’s).On Tuesday, the MeitY launched a scheme for promoting innovations in the fields of healthcare, education, medtech and work from home to prepare for a world after the Covid-19 pandemic.The central government has called for applications from innovators and startups under the Scheme for Accelerating Startups around Post COVID Technology Opportunities (SASACT) for developing or re-purposing technologies, tools, systems, solutions to respond to the post Covid-19 scenario.A fund worth Rs 9.6 crore has been set aside under SASACT, which is a part of the measures issued by MeitY in response to post-pandemic requirements.“The scheme is looking to groom startups based on Information and communications technology, hardware or software in the specific context of a post-Covid-19 world. For example, solutions on home-based healthcare, online tools, education technology, among others,” said said Poyni Bhatt, chief executive officer, Society for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (SINE) at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. SINE is one of the four agencies chosen by the MietY for implementing the scheme.An eligible startup can avail a maximum support upto Rs 40 lakh for the proposed technology product or solutions. A total number of 40-50 proposals will be supported under the scheme, said a statement by the MietY. The grant will be divided into two tranches that will be released in a phased manner based on designated milestones to be intimated at the time of approval of the proposal.“Following the Covid-19 pandemic, a new normal has been created in the country. There are many technology opportunities arising out of this new normal, such as working from home and home-based diagnostics etc. In line with the Atmanirbhar Bharat scheme, we are looking for companies that have established their product but want to go back to the drawing board and rejig their solution to meet these new requirements,” said Ajay Garg, senior director at MietY.Some of the areas in which the government is looking for solutions include smart/ digital manufacturing including 3D printing, digital health/ Medtech, Edutech, Fintech, Work From Home (WFH) and other solutions that address concerns arising in post Covid-19 scenario.

Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has called for a full-fledged crackdown on rapists and other sex offenders in the country, proposing chemical castration for those found guilty in rape cases to ensure they don’t become repeat offenders. He has also called for a national register that can keep track of sex offenders.On Monday, Khan told a regional TV news channel that he feels chemical castration of rapists is urgently needed or at least the culprits should be made to forcefully undergo surgery so that they don’t commit sexual crimes in future.The Pakistan prime minister argued the case for a grading system for rapes and sexual assault cases along the lines of the standard first, second and third-degree classification in place for murder cases.Khan, who was speaking on a recent incident of gang-rape in Lahore that sparked nationwide outrage, said, “Those who are in first degree, they should be castrated and operated upon to disable them from repeating such crimes.”He proposed setting up a three-pronged strategy to deal with rapes and other sexual abuse cases, starting with the registration of sex offenders and paedophiles.Another step, Khan said, to deal with rapists and child sex abusers, was to hand them exemplary punishments. He called for hanging them in public as punishment for scarring the lives of the victims and their families.The Pakistan PM said it wasn’t possible for the administration to know exactly how many rape cases occur across the country, adding that such crimes were routinely under-reported.However, on the topic of public hanging of rapists, Khan said his government believes that such a form of punishment was unlikely to be accepted by the global community, and could even jeopardise the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) that is extended to Pakistan by the European Union.
As Donald Trump on Monday toured parts of California that have been ravaged by wildfires and then reiterated his scepticism of climate change, Joe Biden, his Democratic challenger for the White House race, slammed the US president, calling him a “climate arsonist”.Trump visited California, one of 10 states where wildfires have burnt down nearly 5 million acres of land, killed dozens of people and displaced millions, after weeks of criticism of his indifference towards the crisis and after blaming it on negligent forest management practices.Local officials of Democrat-ruled California accepted the importance of forest management during their interactions with the US president, but argued that climate change should be accepted as having played a role in the devastating West Coast fires.“It’ll start getting cooler, you just watch,” the American president said dismissively after a short presentation by a California official who argued that climate change should be recognised as the real cause of the fires.The state official then told the US president, “I wish science agreed with you,” to which Trump responded, saying, “I don’t think science knows, actually.”The exchange of words went viral on social media as yet another instance of climate crisis denial by the US president. Trump had been downplaying the climate crisis right from his pre-presidency days, when he had claimed that climate change was a hoax fanned by China to slow down the growth of industrialised countries.Since taking office in January 2017, Trump has pulled the US out of the Paris Accord, claiming it had given India and China a sweeter deal, and has decidedly rolled back all clean air and water orders issued by his predecessor, Barack Obama.“Donald Trump’s climate denial may not have caused these fires, record floods and record hurricanes,” former vice-president Biden said in a speech in Wilmington, Delaware, tying the catastrophic natural events to the climate crisis. “But if he gets a second term, these hellish events will become more common, more devastating and more deadly.”Bided added, “If you give a climate arsonist four more years in the White House, why would anyone be surprised if we have more of America ablaze?”The Democratic presidential candidate promised to take the US back to the Paris Accord that Obama as president had brokered with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping, leaders of the world’s top polluters after America.“While he (Trump) turns us against our allies, I will bring us back into the Paris Agreement, Biden said. “I will put us back in the business of leading the world on climate change. And I will challenge everyone to up the ante on their climate commitments.”

Appreciate it. Now let’s do an action film together,” he commented on the post. Fans, too, were excited at the prospect of the two teaming up.In a statement, John said that Dino’s performance was outstanding. “My friend Dino Morea has outdone himself as a cold-blood assassin! It’s taken me back to my days when I played similar ‘bad-boy’ roles, which is tougher than it looks because you have to make people like you and hate you at the same time! If there is a season 3, I wouldn’t mind trying a complex role like this!,” he said.Dino plays a remorseless assassin named Ranbir in Hostages season 2. John has played a number of negative roles in the past, including Aetbaar, Dhoom and Shootout At Wadala.John has a number of projects in the pipeline.

Sam Billings played an incredible innings for England in the first ODI at Old Trafford against Australia. Billings walked on the field when England were struggling at 57-4 and had to chase a target of 295 runs. Jonny Bairstow was struggling at the other end and it looked like things would become really difficult. But Billings and Bairstow stuck around to get through that phase and eventually made England believe that they could win. Billings stayed till the end to score 118 runs and took the match to the last over. They eventually lost by 19 runs but Billings made a case for a permanent spot in the England middle-order.Despite his century against England, Billings admits that he still would not be able to cement his place as number five batsman. And it is due to the presence of Ben Stokes.READ | 1st ODI: Hazlewood stars as Australia beat England by 19 runsHis remark comes ahead of the second ODI against Australia. In the first match, the right-handed batsman Billings was able to play a knock of 118 runs, but England fell short by 19 runs in the first match.England is without the services of Ben Stokes for the ongoing ODI series against Australia as the all-rounder is in New Zealand with his family.“Ben Stokes isn’t here and I don’t think, however many runs I get, that I’ll keep that spot. All I can do is stake a claim. Especially building towards the T20 stuff. There is a slot in that late-to-middle order. Hopefully, this will keep pushing my case in that format. Loss of form and injury - as I found out the hard way - can happen. As long as you are putting yourself in the right position to be the next cab off the rank, you never know when these opportunities will arise,” ESPNCricinfo quoted Billings as saying.England was chasing 295 in the first ODI against Australia and the hosts were in a spot of bother at 57/4 when Billings and Jonny Bairstow got together at the crease.The duo formed a partnership of 113 runs, and Billings got going tough during the course as he was slow to get off the blocks.“Australia reminded me I was 11 of 32 pretty consistently. At that point in time, we had zero chance. I felt terrible as well. I wasn’t fluent at all. But then you look at the other end and Jonny is struggling as well and he’s one of the most fluent openers in world cricket. No one really got going,” Billings said.“But you could see Australia’s mindset definitely change when we started to get that partnership going. The energy all of a sudden went from very positive to just slightly more intensity and thinking that we are getting ourselves back into the game. Who knows, if Jonny and I had batted for another five overs; if Moeen Ali and I could have got a bit of a partnership together... Yes, it was a huge ask. But in that situation it’s a matter of trying to take the game deep and give us some sort of chance,” he added.Mitchell Marsh, Glenn Maxwell, Adam Zampa, and Josh Hazlewood came up with standout performances to hand visitors a win in the first ODI. Marsh and Maxwell had played knocks of 73 and 77 while Hazlewood returned with figures of 3-26 from his ten overs. Zampa had claimed four wickets as well.Australia and England will lock horns in the second ODI of the three-match series on Sunday at Manchester.(with ANI inputs)

The monsoon has gone missing from all of north and north-west India in September , and the heat and humidity the region is witnessing may last for the rest of the season, with experts blaming the monsoon trough from Bay of Bengal travelling in a westerly direction instead of the usual north-westerly one for this.The sultry conditions may last for the next 10-13 days, the experts added, at least till the monsoon fully withdraws from the region without any rainfall.The withdrawal will finally result in pleasant weather, they added.According to the India Meteorological Department, the rainfall deficit in the northern part of India in September is near total -- up to 99% of the normal, the highest for any region in the country.The southern states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana received up to 50% excess rain during the same period with Chitradurga district in Karnataka seeing 245% excess rainfall.In Himachal, the tribal district of Kinnaur, known for its delicious royal apples harvested this month, received 88% less rainfall, the highest for any district in the state. In Uttar Pradesh, the western parts were almost dry with districts such Bulandshahr and Mathura recording 100% rain deficiency.Delhi was slightly better than its neighbouring states with 61% rain deficiency. New Delhi, the seat of the Central government, recorded 76% less rainfall than normal, the most for any district in the national capital. Likewise, southern Haryana districts such as Gurugram and Faridabad recorded close to 90% less rainfall.“Only one trough formed in the Bay of Bengal during this period and that also travelled towards the westerly direction bringing in some rain in West Bengal, Odisha and North-East India. Hence, the north and north-west remained dry,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president, climate and meteorology, Skymet Weather, a private forecaster.North and north-west India receive rains due to the oscillation of troughs, getting its moisture feed from the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea. With few troughs forming, the region witnessed westerly winds adding to the humid conditions, said an IMD scientist, who asked not to be named as he is not authorised to speak to media.The warmer-than-usual period, with temperatures ranging from 32 degrees Celsius in the hills of Himachal and Uttarakhand to 39 degrees in Delhi, five to eight degrees above normal, showed its impact on horticulture crops.“Because of the excessive heat, the colour of apples in my orchards turned almost yellow from red. No rain has resulted in leaf-fall turning the fruit, which looked good a month ago, into bad quality. Nobody buys a small size and pale red apple,” said Chander Mohan Justa, an orchad owner in Shimla.Devendra Sharma, an agriculture expert, said poor rainfall in the food bowl states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, could have some impact in the kharif output. “Though the sowing was good because of good early monsoon rains, the dry patch in August and September has hurt farmers.”North and north-west India’s loss was east and south India’s gain -- depressions in the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal moved towards the west bringing heavy rains.The western coast, from Maharashtra to Kerala received 90-100% excess rain whereas most of the North-Eastern states received up to 50% more rainfall than normal, IMD data showed.A recent study by the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, said that by the end of this century southern India is likely to register the maximum increase in rainfall compared to the states in central and north India. “In the worst-case scenario, rainfall could increase by 2.7 mm per day in north India and by 18.5 mm per day in Western Ghats in southern India,” said Rajib Maity, a professor of civil engineering at IIT Kharagpur, who led the study.In its weekly forecast, IMD did not project any major rainfall in the remaining part of the monsoon season; the monsoon is expected to withdraw from western India in the third week of September. The temperature is expected to be higher than normal for northern and central Indian plains.The anti-cyclone activity, a sign of monsoon withdrawal from western India, is now visible in central Pakistan, meaning that the monsoon will start withdrawing from Rajasthan in a week, Palawat said.Despite less rainfall in September, Mritunjay Mohapatra, director-general of IMD, said on September 8 that je expected the overall monsoon in India to be 102% of the normal with south, central and western India receiving substantially more than normal rainfall .“We are not expecting any improvement in rain deficiency over northwest India now because we are heading towards monsoon withdrawal,” said DS Pai, senior scientist, IMD Pune, agreeing that the monsoon is pretty much over in northern India.
Actor Rashami Desai has slammed recent media reports questioning her relationship with the late celebrity manager Disha Salian. Rashami has said that she spoke to Disha just a day prior to her death, but is disheartened by how stories have been spun around her.Taking to Twitter on Wednesday, she wrote, “Its disheartening to see tht certain section of media are cutting all the limits to showcase fake news. As I personally experience I can totally empathize to all those who have fallen pray to it. Invasion of my privacy in the name of news isn’t cool. Stay real but first stay kind.”Its disheartening to see tht certain section of media are cutting all the limits to showcase fake news. As I personally experience I can totally empathize to all those who have fallen pray to it. Invasion of my privacy in the name of news isn't cool. Stay real but first stay kind — Rashami Desai (@TheRashamiDesai) September 16, 2020Earlier, Rashami had told Republic TV that she had spoken to Disha on June 7, after a gap of several months. Disha died after falling from a building, in what is believed to be a suicide. Her death was further put in the spotlight after Sushant Singh Rajput was found dead at his home a few days later, on June 14. Sushant was briefly managed by Disha, and according to his flatmate Siddharth Pithani, was very disturbed at his name being attached to news reports of her death.Rashami told the news channel, “Yes, I had actually spoken to her a day prior to the incident actually. On 7th. We did not speak at length that time actually, we said that we could not speak over the phone. Eventually, we made some plans to meet for later on but then the next day I got the sad news.” She added that during their phonecall on June 7, they had discussed travelling to Shimla in October.After Disha’s death, Rashami had posted an Instagram story, in which she’d written, “I still can’t believe that it was your birthday a few days back, still can’t believe that we attended Zoom Call Party, can believe that you posted your favourite picture and wrote - YOU ARE YOUR OWN CHOICE, putting a #makewisechoices. What made you choose this? Left all your loved ones, especially your parents, your friends and the workplace you always loved. I’ve always known you as a strong and stable personality. Wherever you are, you will always be in my prayers Disha.”
“I’ve taken it as a time for reflection and to spend time with my mom and dad. It was definitely hard in the beginning. Every extension came with anxiety and stress, but slowly I managed to be active on social media and do all my classes for my projects online. But now, I’m ready and craving to go back to work,” says actor Amyra Dastur.The 27-year-old, made her debut in 2013 with Manish Tiwary’s Isaaq, says that “Bollywood is India’s favourite scapegoat”. “If anything bad happens, then automatically Bollywood gets the blame. Yes, there are issues in our Industry but there are issues everywhere. The only problem we face is that our lives are public which makes people think they have the right to comment about it. In other words, we’re damned if we do and damned if we don’t,” she says.About the ongoing insider-outsider debate and nepotism, Dastur says, “As an outsider it definitely hurts to see star kids getting roles you feel they haven’t earned. But you can’t hold it against them. If you’re given an advantage in life then you should capitalise on it. Ultimately, the audience decides and if they like someone then they themselves will follow them and increase the persons popularity. Unfortunately, we’re so stuck on hating star kids that we don’t realise if the audience channels that hate into kindness for promoting outsiders, it would change the game.”Ask her if favouritism and groupism exists in the industry, and she says, “Yes, it does. But it exists in every industry. We don’t live in a black and white world. There are favourites and there is groupism which you need to deal with. The boycotting is something that I don’t agree with and I believe it needs to be tackled. You can have your favourites but you shouldn’t put someone down because they don’t adhere to your opinions. That’s what the problem is, not favouritism but the boycotting and catty environment. Putting people down has become so easy lately with social media or blind items or even in film criticism. These kinds of personal attacks cause major mental trauma and it needs to be filtered and stopped.”
Updated: Sep 09, 2020 19:46 ISTNEET 2020: In a bid to ease travel woes of several thousand National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) aspirants, the Metro Railway in Kolkata has decided to operate special services on September 13, an official said on Wednesday.This service will be exclusively for medical entrance examinees and their guardians, Metro Railway spokesperson Indrani Banerjee said.Examinees will have to show NEET admit cards at the gates of Metro stations, she said.Normal Metro services were suspended due to lockdown announced in March and efforts are on to restart operations soon.“No token will be issued to commuters and only printed card tickets will be issued to the bonafide students and their guardians,” Banerjee said.A total of 66 trains - 33 each in up and down directions - will be run on September 13 from 11 am to 7 pm from the two terminal stations, Noapara and Kavi Subhash.These services will be available in every 15 minutes, she said.Candidates for Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) had faced a tough time reaching exam centres due to lack of transport facilities earlier this month.
In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, all exams of the University of Jammu which were scheduled on September 9, 10, and 11, have been postponed as the main campus shall remain closed on these dates, informed the University of Jammu on Tuesday.The university further said that fresh dates for holding the postponed exams will be notified separately.“The Main Campus of the University shall remain closed for three days i.e. w.e.f. 9th to 11th September 2020, it is notified for the information of all concerned that all the examinations of the University of Jammu slated to be held on the aforesaid dates stand postponed and fresh dates for holding such postponed examinations shall be notified separately,” read a notification by the university.
Tanmay Srivastava, the highest scorer of U-19 World Cup in 2008 when Virat Kohli led India to the title, talked about the transition from U-19 cricket to first-class cricket being a difficult one.The left-hander, who is a veteran in first-class cricket now, said he was often sledged at the early part of his career when he just started to play first-class cricket after the World Cup success.“When I went to play Ranji Trophy after playing the U-19 WC, I still remember initially for a few games when I took guard..’Piche slips se aawaz aati thi, bhai ye U-19 cricket nahi hai, baccho ka cricket nahi hai.’ So initially, I used to get surprised why people said this. However, over a period of time I realized that FC cricket is the real test,” Srivastava said in a conversation with sports presenter Yash Kashikar on his Instagram live show ‘Say Yash to Sports.’The left-hander had scored 262 runs in just 6 matches at an average of 52.40 in the 2008 edition of the U-19 World Cup.“When you come there after playing at the U-19 level, lot of people follow your performance. So, the first few games become very important. If you do well there, you tend to get a bit comfortable and your position in the team also gets fixed.“But, if you don’t perform well, you have to go back and again play age/group cricket, score tons of runs and wait for your chance and see if the team combination works or not. So there are certain advantages when you come after playing at the U-19 level, but at the same time your responsibility increases a lot as well,” added Srivastava who currently plays for Uttarakhand in frist-class cricket and also led them after Unmukt Chand was sacked as captain midway through the season.Srivastava, who has played 90 first-class matches and scored 4918 runs so far, said Virat Kohli always had the hunger to be the best in anything he did.“ Even when Virat (Kohli) played with me, he had the hunger to be the number one player in the team. Whatever he did he wanted to be the best in it. While batting he wanted to score the most number of runs, while fielding he wanted to be the best, and even while playing any game he wanted to win that as well. So, he always wanted to prove something.Also, over the years he has taken his game to a different level altogether. If you see, whether it is batting, fielding or fitness for that matter. The entire world admires him. The changes he brought in his game and the sacrifices he made, only because of it he is the best in the world right now,” Srivastava added.
As Bigg Boss 14 gets ready to land on October 3, fans are already speculating who will enter the Salman Khan hosted show this year. One of the names doing the round online is that of YouTuber Carry Minati and he has finally responded. He also addressed many people trolling him over the reports.During an online chat, Carry said, “Arre yaar, Sorry, maine tera dil dukha diya yaar. Mujhe maaf kar de. Jo insaan ja nahi raha use jabardasti bhej do aur use jute maaro chappal maro (My dear friend, I am sorry I broke your heart, Please forgive me. Force a person to enter the show when he isn't really going and then slam him for doing so). Nice job!.” A user had asked, “Bigg Boss kyu? Dude you are so cool, not meant for you.”Another user asked him, “You were supposed to roast them, not join them.” Carry responded, “Aji kis kagaz pe likha hai that I have joined them? Wo kagaz dikha mujhe (Where is it written that I have joined them? Show me the papers).”Carry also took to Twitter to categorically deny the rumours. “I am not going in Bigg Boss! Don’t believe in everything you read,” he wrote.”I am not going in Bigg Boss!Don't believe in everything you read. 😐 — Ajey Nagar (@CarryMinati) September 16, 2020Apart from Carry, a few other names are also being speculated to be on the show. While Adhyayan Suman denied being a part of the show, Onir, Chahat Pandey and Rajeev Sen have also refuted similar rumours.Adhyayan took to Twitter to clear the air and wrote, “False news of me being a part of big boss ! Thanks but no thanks ! Disrespectful to say the least ! #BigBoss @ColorsTV please clarify this! Regards.” He tweeted after a fan wrote, “Please dont take part in big boss. I dont want you to fight in big boss for petty issues. Please live a dignified n respectful life. I want to watch you in movies not in Tv Shows. Keep smiling have a better year ahead. Thank You.” The actor replied, “Even if it was the end of the world I Would never go there don’t worry ! That’s not my career goal.”Those who are expected to join the show include Jasmin Bhasin, Nishant Malkani, Aly Goni, Nia Sharma, Pavitra Punia, Akanksha Puri, Nishant Malkani, Eijaz Khan, Naina Singh, Jaan Kumar Sanu and Vivian Dsena.Promos of Bigg Bos 14 are already out as the show will begin on October 3. A recent statement by Colors TV, released alongside a picture of Salman mopping the floor, said, “Salman says everyone is bored of shuttling between home and work. But not to phikar not as life is about to change with Bigg Boss’s power-packed entertainment coming for their rescue.”
The Karnataka government on Saturday prohibited Class 9 to 12 students from visiting schools and pre-university colleges to meet teachers in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic.According to a statement issued by the government, the students were earlier allowed by the education department after COVID-19 cases in the state had come down.However, as the pandemic continues to rage the state, the state government felt it was not safe to call students to colleges or schools to meet teachers, it said.
Kamala Harris is partly of Indian descent, not wholly. But most of us in India would do well to remember that she is running for an election in the United States (US), not in India.This is a crucial difference to keep in mind when commentaries will begin to be written that she is not owning her Indian-ness enough. I know, because I wrote once that Harris needed to embrace her Indian heritage more. I still stand by that. But I am not the one running for vice-president.Harris will run as a Black woman. That’s the key reason why the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Joe Biden, picked her, apart from her other obviously stellar qualifications such as being a US senator, former attorney-general of the largest American state, relatively younger age — 55 to Biden’s 77 — and, for a vice-presidential nominee, an ability to throw a punch. “I think he came to the conclusion that he should pick a Black woman,” Harry Reid, a former top US Senate Democrat, told the New York Times. “They are our most loyal voters and I think that the Black women of America deserved a Black vice-presidential candidate.” It’s an electoral compulsion, plainly. And Indians — and Indian Americans, specifically — should set aside for now their expectations of seeing Harris be more Indian.It will not be easy because as electioneering gets underway, Harris will be all Black. The Biden campaign will deploy her as their chief conduit to African American voters, the country’s second-largest voting bloc. They will be critical in the key swing states of Florida, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan, Virginia and vulnerable Republican-ruled states.Through all that, Harris will find the time and opportunity to signal her Indian-ness, insist people who have known her for years. And that will invariably be a reference to her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, a breast cancer researcher, who passed away in 2009.Harris often tweets pictures of her mother to mark special occasions and milestones in her life. Never her father, Donald Jasper Harris, a Stanford professor.Appearing with Biden for the first time after being named his running mate, Harris spoke of her mixed heritage. She dwelt most expansively and feelingly, however, on her mother, for inspiring her to a life in public service, which would land her a place in history books, as the first Black woman on a presidential ticket.On November 3, or whenever the results are declared in what is likely to be the most unpredictable election yet, she might become the first woman vice-president, of whichever party, colour or ethnic origin.Gopalan, a diminutive woman from Chennai, who studied at Lady Irwin College in Delhi before heading out to the US, will remain Harris’s abiding link to India, though Harris still can’t make a dosa, as she confessed to Mindy Kaling in a video they shot months before. But she deserves a break, from some of us.The views expressed are personal
The Tamil Nadu School Education Department has formed a 13-member high-level committee to study the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 in order to advise the government on two-language policy and other issues.While describing the functions and other terms of reference for the expert committee, the government said it will “advise the Government of Tamil Nadu on the policy response on all thrust areas of the National Education Policy 2020 subject to the state of Tamil Nadu continuing with its two-language policy.”It will “advise on the implementation of the National Education Policy 2020 as is relevant to Tamil Nadu in the short, medium, and long term based on resource availability,” the government added.The committee is expected to submit its final report after due consultation with all relevant stakeholders, within a period of one year from the date of its constitution.The expert committee shall be assisted by the Director of School Education and the State Project Director Samagra Shiksha for the facilitation of their work.The government added that in view of the coronavirus pandemic, if necessary, the committee can conduct its meetings virtually.The Union Cabinet on July 29 approved National Education Policy 2020 bringing major reforms in higher education including a target of 50 per cent Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) by 2035 and provision for multiple entry and exits.

The world’s biggest oil company is getting squeezed by its main shareholder, the Saudi Arabian government.Even with crude dropping below $40 a barrel this week and its cash flow plunging, Saudi Aramco is trying to pay a $75 billion dividend this year, almost all of it to the state. Concerns are mounting, including among global fund managers who bought into the company during a record initial public offering last December, that Aramco is putting strategic projects on ice and racking up debt too quickly.Aramco has been the country’s cash cow for decades. But the pressure it faces has been thrown into sharper relief by the coronavirus-induced collapse in energy demand -- Brent crude fell another 5% on Tuesday -- and now that it’s a listed firm with shareholders from New York to Tokyo.Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the 35-year-old de facto ruler, has pledged to diversify the kingdom from oil and spend billions developing everything from futuristic cities to tourism and financial services. For that, he needs Aramco’s money.“The crown prince has basically decided the company is a piggy bank he can raid to fund his other projects,” said Jean-Francois Seznec, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council of Washington’s Global Energy Center, and a Middle Eastern specialist. “It will limit how much they can invest in things like maintaining the oil fields and developing new technologies.”Dividend PromiseThe government has previously leveraged Aramco’s balance sheet to bolster its own finances. But it hasn’t happened to this extent for at least 20 years, according to one banker who’s worked with the company since the 1990s.Fitch Ratings Ltd. estimates the Saudi budget deficit will rise to 15% of gross domestic product in 2020, one of the widest levels in the Middle East. The government’s revenue fell almost 50% year-on-year in the second quarter.Aramco promised to pay $75 billion annually to investors for five years after the IPO. Eager to attract foreign funds and achieve a world record valuation of $2 trillion, the government even said last year it may forgo its own portion of the dividend and maintain it for others if oil prices fell.Instead, the axe is falling elsewhere. Aramco has slashed capital expenditure by tens of billions of dollars, laid off hundreds of mainly foreign workers and shuffled its top management as part of a plan to sell some assets.It paid a dividend of $37.5 billion in the first six months of 2020 even as rivals Royal Dutch Shell Plc, BP Plc and Eni SpA cut theirs. The payouts were almost double Aramco’s free cash flow of $21 billion.The dividends -- and a $69 billion acquisition of chemicals maker Sabic from the Saudi sovereign wealth fund -- have bloated the company’s debt levels, though they are still below those of most Big Oil firms. The gearing ratio climbed from -5% at the end of March, meaning Aramco had more cash than debt, to 20% in June, above its targeted range of 5% to 15%.Gearing could reach 30% by 2023 if crude prices remain below $60 a barrel and Aramco doesn’t reduce the dividend, according to David Havens, head of energy equity research at SMBC Nikko Securities America.The market doubts oil will rise to that level anytime soon. Brent crude will average just $47.50 next year and $53 in 2022, according to the median forecast of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.Aramco “has the lowest upstream costs of any major energy company,” a spokesperson said in a statement. “This provides a level of flexibility in our capital spending plans during this downturn, supporting our ability to maintain dividends.”The Saudi government’s Center for International Communication, which fields inquiries from foreign media, did not respond to requests for comment.Projects on IceExecutives have shelved several major projects in recent months, including a $20 billion Red Sea facility to turn crude into chemicals and a liquefied natural gas export terminal in Texas. A $10 billion refinery in China has also been put on hold, Bloomberg reported, though Aramco said it’s still committed to investing in the world’s second-largest economy.Aramco had hatched these plans to gain additional outlets for its crude and weather the global energy transition to cleaner fuels such as gas.The company probably made the right call curbing investment in costly downstream projects that are unlikely to yield profits comparable to its main business of pumping oil, said Allen Good, an analyst at Morningstar Inc.Outdoing RivalsAramco’s come through the oil crisis better than its peers so far. Its second-quarter profit of $6.6 billion may have been down 73% from a year earlier, but it was easily the highest of any energy firm. BP lost $6.7 billion and Exxon Mobil Corp. $1.1 billion.The Saudi company’s share price has gained 1% in Riyadh this year, in large part because of the dividend pledge. Shell’s has slumped 51% and BP’s 44%.The crown prince’s desire to get money out of Aramco may only increase, however. Since Chairman Yasir Al-Rumayyan said earlier this year he wanted to sell some assets, the economy has worsened. The government has been forced to raise taxes and reduce public workers’ allowances.Aramco is already looking at selling a stake in its oil pipelines to raise around $10 billion, Bloomberg reported in April.Prince Mohammed and the government “really need Aramco to help the kingdom overcome Covid-19 and transition to a post-oil era,” said Neil Quilliam, head of Azure Strategy, an advisory firm focused on the Middle East. “In the process, they will likely damage the country’s most profitable company.”

We all have our favourite teams while growing up but how many of us end up representing the same team as a player a few years later? New Zealand fast bowler Lockie Ferguson is one of those rare ones to have realised that dream when he picked up by IPL franchise Kolkata Knight Riders ahead of last year’s IPL.Ferguson, who will be one of KKR’s main weapons as far as fast bowling is considered along with Australia’s Pat Cummins, said he had been a KKR fan ever since that Brendon McCullum blitz in the inaugural match of IPL back in 2008.Also Read | Full coverage of IPL 2020McCullum had smashed an unbeaten 158 runs off just 73 balls in the first IPL match against Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2008, which acted as the perfect curtain raiser for the tournament. The former New Zealand skipper, who is now the coach of KKR, had hit 10 fours and 13 sixes in that blistering innings.“We used to watch IPL as young chaps. Brendon (McCullum) was definitely one of our heroes while growing up. After watching him do so well in the first match for KKR, it was hard not to be a Kolkata fan. So yeah, I am super excited and I think Purple and Gold doesn’t look bad on me at all,” KKR official website quoted Ferguson as saying.Ferguson also spoke about playing in front of large crowds in the IPL.Also Read | Kevin Pietersen predicts the winner of IPL 2020“Well, I loved watching the first season when Brendon was smashing it all over the park. We didn’t know how big IPL was potentially going to be. I think it was difficult to measure for a Kiwi because here for Black Caps, a crowd of 20,000 is a big crowd. So, my first season at Pune in front of a sold-out crowd was extremely difficult because I couldn’t get over the noise. Seeing it on TV is one thing but being out there on the field in the IPL is a whole different ballThe right-arm seamer who can clock over 150 km/h said KKR side looks strong this year and they would be trying to better their last year’s performance.“The team we have (for this season) is looking super strong. Last year, we ended up sort of mid-table, so hopefully, this year we will get a chance to improve on that performance,” he added.Ferguson also said that he is looking forward to playing under the KKR coach as McCullum’s aggressive nature on the field resonates with his bowling style.“In my international career, I just missed out on having him as my captain. It was just after the World Cup here in New Zealand. I have bowled to him a few times at the nets. He is one of those New Zealanders who played the game the way he thought it should be played,” the Kiwi pacer said.The 13th edition of the IPL kickstarts from September 19 with defending champions Mumbai Indians taking on Chennai Super Kings in Abu Dhabi.KKR will play their first match on September 23 against Mumbai Indians.
A Bollywood actor late on Saturday accused filmmaker Anurag Kashyap of sexual assault. In an interview, she mentioned that the incident happened during the making of Bombay Velvet. Anurag later took to Twitter to deny all claims and called them baseless.Taking to Twitter, Anurag wrote in Hindi, “Kya baat hai, itna samay le liya mujhe chup karwane ki koshish mein. Chalo koi nahin. Mujhe chup karaate karaate itna jhoot bol gaye ki aurat hote hue doosri auraton ko bhi sang ghhaseet liya. Thodi toh maryada rakheye, madam.

Eddie Nketiah came off the bench to score an 85th-minute winner Saturday as Arsenal beat West Ham 2-1 for a second straight victory to open the Premier League.The England under-21 striker had only been on the field for eight minutes when he stretched to tap in a low cross from Dani Ceballos after Arsenal broke through the offside trap.Alexandre Lacazette’s 25th-minute opener for Arsenal, set up by a pinpoint cross from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, was canceled out by a well-worked team goal finished off by Michail Antonio just before halftime at Emirates Stadium.West Ham has lost both of its games so far, having been beaten 2-0 by Newcastle last weekend.Arsenal opened with a 3-0 win at Fulham.

Inhaled versions of Covid-19 vaccine candidates developed by Oxford University and Imperial College will be trialled to see if they deliver a localised immune response in the respiratory tract, British researchers said on Monday.The Oxford and Imperial vaccines are both being tested in trials through intramuscular injection, but scientists from Imperial said that vaccines delivered via inhalation could potentially deliver a more specialised response.Chris Chiu, of Imperial’s Department of Infectious Disease, said there was evidence that flu vaccines delivered by nasal spray could protect against and reduce transmission of the disease.“We are keen to explore if this may also be the case for SARS-CoV-2 and whether delivering Covid-19 vaccines to the respiratory tract is safe and produces an effective immune response,” he said in a statement.Trials of the Oxford vaccine, which has been licensed to AstraZeneca, resumed at the weekend after safety watchdogs gave it the go-ahead. Late-stage trials had been paused after study subject fell in Britain.“We have already shown that (Oxford vaccine) ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) is safe and induces strong immune responses after intramuscular injection,” said Sarah Gilbert of the University of Oxford.“Delivering the vaccine to the respiratory tract instead may be a good approach to inducing immune responses in the best place to enable a rapid response after exposure to airborne virus.”Imperial’s vaccine is also in clinical trials, although at an earlier stage.The new trials of the vaccines will see volunteers receive aerosolised vaccines through a nebulizer, delivering the vaccine as airborne droplets through a mouthpiece. A total of 30 people will be recruited to the trials.Previous studies suggest that lower doses might be required than in intramuscular injections to give protection, the Imperial researchers said.

The Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) on Wednesday announced that Silver Lake, a US-based private equity firm, will invest Rs 7,500 crore in Reliance Retail Ventures (RRVL), a subsidiary of the RIL. The investment, RIL said, will give Silver Lake a 1.5% equity stake in its retail venture.The transaction, Reliance Industries said, values Reliance Retail Ventures at an equity value of Rs 4.21 lakh crore.Speaking about the deal, Mukesh Ambani, chairman and Managing Director of RIL, said, “I am delighted to extend our relationship with Silver Lake to our transformational efforts of building an inclusive partnership with millions of small merchants while providing value to Indian consumers across the country in the Indian retail sector”.This marks the second investment by Silver Lake in a Reliance Industries’ group company. Earlier, it had invested $1.35 billion in Jio Platforms, becoming the first US private equity firm to invest in Jio, after social media giant Facebook purchased a 9.99% stake in the company in April.
Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday asked the basic shiksha (basic education) department to recruit 31,661 assistant teachers within a week as the state government was committed to providing enough jobs and employment opportunities to the youth, said a statement from the chief minister’s office.A state government spokesperson said the basic shiksha department had conducted a recruitment examination on January 6, 2019, for filling 69,000 vacant posts of assistant teachers. According to a government order of January 7, 2019, the state government fixed 65% as the minimum percentage of marks for appointment of general category candidates and 60% for backward and other reserved classes of candidates.मुख्यमंत्री श्री @myogiadityanath जी ने बेसिक शिक्षा विभाग में 31,661 सहायक अध्यापकों की भर्ती प्रक्रिया को एक सप्ताह में पूरा करने के निर्देश दिए हैं।उन्होंने कहा है कि प्रदेश सरकार युवाओं को नौकरी सहित रोजगार के पर्याप्त अवसर उपलब्ध कराने के लिए कृतसंकल्पित है। — Yogi Adityanath Office (@myogioffice) September 19, 2020After this, some candidates moved the Allahabad high court. Later, the high court gave its verdict in favour of the state government while hearing the main writ petition ‘Ramsharan Maurya vs state government’.On May 21, the high court ordered that, barring the assistant teachers’ posts held by shiksha mitras, the remaining vacancies should be filled.
The Maharashtra government on Tuesday scrapped the 70:30 region-wise formula for admission in medical courses in the state.The formula implied reservation for 70 per cent locals (from that region) in medical colleges and 30 per cent from rest of the state.Making an announcement in the state Assembly, Medical Education Minister Amit Deshmukh said admissions would now be based on the results of students who have appeared for the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET).“Instead of the 70:30 quota, it would be ‘one Maharashtra, one merit’,” the minister said.Students and parents in the state had since long been demanding the scrapping of the contentious 70:30 formula for admissions in medical courses.Under the quota, 70 per cent seats in medical colleges were reserved for students in their districts.The number of medical colleges in the state’s Marathwada and Vidarbha regions are less compared to other areas. Hence, students from these regions suffered during admissions in medical colleges.

Star Australia batsman Steve Smith remains a doubtful starter for the second ODI against England on Sunday after he copped a knock to his head during training and will undergo a second concussion test to decide his availability.Smith was a late withdrawal from Friday’s first ODI – which Australia won by 19 runs to go 1-0 up in the three-match series- after sustaining a blow on the head in the nets from a throw-down by a coaching staff member on the match eve.Smith, the World’s number one Test batsman is understood to have subsequently undergone a concussion test and was omitted from the first ODI side “as a precautionary measure.”“He got a knock on the head in practice. It’s a precautionary measure to leave him out,” Australia limited-overs captain Aaron Finch had said.A spokesperson for the Australia team confirmed Smith would undergo a further assessment on Saturday before any decision is made about his availability for the second ODI on Sunday afternoon. He was also infamously felled by a Jofra Archer bouncer at Lord’s during last year’s Ashes. That knock caused him to miss the second innings of that Test and the following match as well.There is also doubt over left-arm seamer Mitchell Starc’s availability for the second match of the series after having experienced some groin pain on Friday. He managed to complete his 10 overs after slipping on the field but will be assessed over the next 24 hours. “He’s a little bit sore but we’ll see how he pulls up and go from there,” Josh Hazlewood said.Australia are in with a chance to claim a bilateral ODI series win over England for the first time since 2015 and end the recent dominance by Eoin Morgan’s men in 50-over cricket. England have won 11 of their past 14 encounters against Australia.
Updated: Sep 18, 2020 14:59 ISTAnother outbreak in China has sparked a wave of concern among authorities after thousands of people in the northern part of the country tested positive for a bacterial infection. The infection spread among people working in a state-owned biopharmaceutical plant in Lanzhou city, which produces animal vaccines after a leak occurred last year.Here’s all you need to know about Brucellosis outbreak:* According to Chinese authorities, the biopharmaceutical plant had used expired disinfectants for producing Brucella vaccines for animals between July and August last year. This indicated that the bacteria was not eradicated in the factory exhaust.* Subsequently, the contaminated gas from the factory formed aerosols containing the bacteria, which was then carried by wind to a nearby Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute. This resulted in infecting close to 200 people there as well in December last year.* There are 3,245 people who have contracted Brucellosis, according to health officials in Lanzhou. Another 1,401 people also tested as an early positive for the disease, news agency AFP reported. The total positive cases also included 20 students and faculty members of Lanzhou University, some of whom had been to the institute.* Brucellosis, caused by brucella bacteria, is often caused by close contact with infected animals or animal products that can bring about fevers, joint pain and headaches.* Health authorities have said there has been no evidence of person-to-person transmission of Brucellosis so far. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that person-to-person transmission of brucellosis is “extremely rare” but some symptoms may reoccur or never go away.* This infection outbreak, like other such as the coronavirus disease, has also traced its origin to animals. Sheep, cattle and pigs were most commonly involved in the spread of the bacteria, Lanzhou’s health commission has said.* In this infection, some symptoms like recurrent fevers, chronic fatigue, swelling of the heart or arthritis are expected to never go away and reoccur in patients who have tested positive, according to the US’ CDC.* Brucellosis also goes by the name of Malta fever or Mediterranean fever and can cause symptoms including headaches, muscle pain, fever and fatigue.
Kamala Harris’s arrival on the Democratic presidential ticket has helped prompt an historic outpouring of contributions, bringing in women donors, Californians and others who had avoided donating to the Biden campaign until they saw his running-mate pick.The pace and magnitude of the mostly virtual fundraising for the Biden-Harris ticket far eclipse what she accomplished during her own presidential run last year and has thrust her into a highly visible role among small-dollar and big-dollar donors, starting with the Democratic bastions in Hollywood and Silicon Valley.Harris was named Democratic nominee Joe Biden’s running mate on August 11. That month, the Biden campaign and the Democratic National Committee set a record for monthly campaign fundraising with an intake of $364.5 million. Some $48 million alone came in the first two days after Biden announced Harris’s selection.The California senator headlined a fundraiser Monday evening with 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and comedian Amy Poehler that brought in $6 million from 100,000 people with an average donation of $30, Clinton announced. That compares to the $6.3 million that Biden brought in the first 24 hours of his presidential run, when interest was very high.Last week, entertainer Billy Porter and Indian-American television host Padma Lakshmi helped Harris bring in $3 million.“Vice President Biden has never been the strongest fundraiser in Washington,” said Cooper Teboe, a Democratic fundraising strategist in Silicon Valley. “He spent his time in the Senate taking the train home to Delaware every night to be a father to his kids instead of sitting in his office making phone calls, and never fostered the kind of donor relationships many politicians do.”“Senator Harris has been courting supporters and making friends for the better part of two decades. Her nomination was a signal to her Rolodex that it’s game on.”Harris has kept up a torrid pace of virtual fundraisers, holding as many as three a day.“There are a lot of people who were waiting to see who Biden picked,” said California Lieutenant Governor Eleni Kounalakis, a Democrat and longtime Harris supporter who has co-chaired three online events in recent weeks raising more than $11 million for the Biden campaign. “Once she was chosen, it unleashed a cascade of excitement and support for the ticket. Everyone stood up and started clamoring for events.”The fresh influx of campaign contributions speaks to Democratic donors’ enthusiasm for the symbolic significance of Harris’s appointment as vice-presidential nominee, the first Black and Indian-American woman to appear on a major-party presidential ticket.“Kamala was absolutely the right choice for this moment,” said Stacy Mason, executive director of Electing Women Bay Area. “She has a proven track record, and I think in this moment of reckoning in our country, the choice to pick a Black woman was necessary. I think he had no choice.”For the Hollywood-Silicon Valley corridor, it also helps, donors say, that she’s the first Democratic candidate from California on a presidential ticket in the modern political era, just when the state is being ravaged by climate-change driven wildfires.Some big Democratic donors sat on the sidelines until Harris was in. Among those giving for the first time to the ticket now are: Actor George Clooney and his wife, human rights lawyer Amal Clooney; Trisha Cardoso, the former communications head for Showtime Networks; Laura Shell, wife of NBC Universal Media Chief Executive Officer Jeff Shell; and director Lee Daniels, Federal Election Commission filings show. All have attended virtual fundraisers with Harris.Professional fundraisers say her network from three successful statewide races was holding back on giving to the Biden campaign as donors waited to see whether Biden would choose a woman -- and a woman of color they know -- as his running mate.The network of female donors Harris who are now contributing to Biden’s presidential effort includes television producer Dayna Bochco, Esprit Holdings co-founder Susie Tompkins Buell and Seagram heiress Ellen Bronfman Hauptman.“This moment means the world to women in the technology industry,” Teboe said. “They know she understands the nuances of tech and how Silicon Valley can maintain its lead in the innovation economy against China.”Electing Women Bay Area hosted a Sept. 1 fundraiser with a minimum donation of $1,000 per person that took in $1.25 million, more than twice its goal. Of the 55 hosts and co-hosts who were part of the event, 37 had donated to Harris before for state races.Recent fundraisers that featured Harris or Harris and Biden together included a Sept. 8 Bay Area event that raised more than $3 million; an Aug. 26 event in Los Angeles with Lakshmi that raised more than $5 million; and a June 9 event that raised more than $3 million, before Harris was named to the ticket.Though the Trump campaign doesn’t release figures, Vice President Mike Pence’s events typically bring in between $1 million and $1.25 million, according to a GOP fundraiser who asked not to be named because he doesn’t speak for the party.Harris’s fundraising network extends beyond California to alumnae of historically Black colleges, her own Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, and other Black sororities and fraternities. Members of the “Divine Nine,” the historically Black Greek letter fraternities and sororities, poured in donations to Biden’s campaign in amounts corresponding to the year each group was founded after Harris was picked.Gaynell Hendricks, an Alpha Kappa Alpha member who attended a Harris fundraiser during her presidential run, gave money to Biden’s campaign the day the pick was announced. “When she was his choice, that’s certainly energized us.”Female donors, in particular, were dismayed that none of the women running for president last year emerged with the nomination – and were ready to open their wallets after Biden, as he pledged to do, chose a female running mate.“There was a fairly widespread, profound, I would call it grief, after Elizabeth Warren withdrew,” said Steve Phillips, a longtime San Francisco fundraiser and host of the podcast Democracy in Color. “That accrues to Kamala’s benefit now. Donors are saying, yes, we should a have a woman, yes we should have a person of color. That’s the country I want to live in. Now that she is a historic choice for vice president, it taps back to that Obama thing and people wanting to be part of making that history.”
Updated: Sep 08, 2020 17:02 ISTThe Enforcement Directorate’s (ED) investigation against former ICICI Bank managing director (MD) Chanda Kochhar and her husband Deepak Kochhar, who was arrested on Monday night, reveals how both of them were working in tandem as part of a conspiracy to disburse a loan to Videocon group and then used an “elaborate web of entities” for layering the bribe amount of Rs 64 crore.Kochhar, according to the agency, not only actively indulged in laundering the proceeds of the crime and projecting it as ‘untainted’, but also continued to enjoy the laundered sum.Kochhar was arrested at 8.06 pm in ED’s Mumbai office following which the agency informed Chanda Kochhar over the phone that her husband had been arrested.In its remand paper submitted before a special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court on Tuesday while seeking a 14-day custody, ED said that Kochhar’s arrest is “qualitatively more elicitation orientated” and was necessary since he was non-cooperative and needed to be taken to Delhi to confront with voluminous evidence and decipher the money trail.HT has accessed the remand paper.The ED added that the persons examined by it in the case are linked to various “sham transactions” and several documents have been recovered showing details of other companies controlled by Kochhar.Kochhar has been sent to ED custody until September 19.However, Kochhar’s lawyer, Vijay Aggarwal, argued that the arrest was illegal.“The arrest of my client is illegal. The arrest and remand will not stand scrutiny in higher courts. ED has arrested him after joining the investigation and giving 10,000 pages of documents after two years and that too in a seven-year punishable offence, which is illegal,” Aggarwal told HT.The ED probe, whose details have been accessed by HT, has revealed that after ICICI Bank disbursed a loan of around Rs 300 crore -- Rs 283.45 crore was the actual disbursed amount -- to Videocon International Electronics Ltd (VIEL) on September 7, 2009, Rs 64 crore were transferred to Kochhar’s company NuPower Renewables Ltd (NRL) through Supreme Energy Pvt Ltd (SEPL) the very next day.NRL was started by Videocon’s founder, chairman and MD Venugopal Dhoot and Kochhar.Though initially, Dhoot had started SEPL, later he had transferred its control to Kochhar.The agency has prepared an elaborate flowchart on how the money moved from Videocon’s various companies and bank accounts to reach NRL, a company controlled, owned and managed by Kochhar from 2012.Referring to Chanda Kochhar’s role, ED’s remand paper said: “The rate of interest charged by the ICICI Bank on the said Rs 300 crore loan, which was later refinanced on April 26, 2012, was more than 12% per annum, since disbursement of this loan, which at times increased to more than 14% per annum”.ED said: “The accounting entries were made in the books of SEPL by creating provisioning of Rs 32 lakh (of the Rs 64 crore transferred by VIEL to NRL through SEPL) and its reversal follows a pattern of events in ICICI Bank pertaining to allegations against Chanda Kocchar”.It added: “Chanda Kochhar was part of the decision-making process and chairperson/member of the recommending/sanctioning committees for other loans sanctioned to Videocon Group by ICICI Bank.”The SEPL, ED said, was acquired by Pinnacle Energy, a family-run trust of Kochhar.“…an elaborate structure/web of entities was created to ostensibly hold this amount of Rs 64 crore. Loan funds travelled from VIEL to NRL through SEPL, but two intermediaries were brought in for the purpose of layering,” it claimed.The money was used by Kochhar for the purchase of properties such as wind farm projects of 33.15 mega-watt (MW) capacity, the agency stated.ED has further claimed that Kochhar was given multiple opportunities to rebut the allegations against him but his stand has been contrary to the records of the case. “He also wilfully withheld information that was in his exclusive knowledge,” the remand paper stated.The agency has also identified a transaction in Kochhar’s company from abroad.ED officials hinted that Dhoot and Chanda Kochhar might also be called soon for questioning on the basis of Kochhar’s custodial interrogation.
Updated: Sep 18, 2020 15:04 ISTSchools in Meghalaya which are shut for six months due to the Covid-19 pandemic will partially reopen from next week for students to meet teachers to clarify their doubts, Education minister Lahkmen Rymbui said on Friday.The schools will be open for students of class 9 to 12 to meet teachers to clear their doubts but there will be no regular classes and no classroom session, he said.“Schools will be partially opened up from September 21 for students to come and meet their teachers and clarify doubts on subjects they find it difficult. There will be no regular classes and no classroom sessions,” Rymbui told PTI.The guidelines for reopening of schools have been issued on Thursday, he said.The Education minister said the state government has rationalised the school curriculum for this academic year and the adjusted academic calendar for all levels in view of COVID-19 pandemic.As per the guidelines issued by the Education Department principal secretary DP Wahlang, “regular” classroom activities in schools, colleges and other educational institutions would remain closed till September 30 across the state.The direction from the Ministry of Home Affairs which emphasised on easing restrictions in areas outside containment areas across the country, has also been taken into consideration.“Regular class activities for schools, colleges, and educational institutions will continue to remain closed up to September, 30,” Wahlang said in the order.Students who intend to attend the teacher-student counselling would have to get the written consent of their parents or guardians to visit the schools and educational institutions.Schools should have flexibility in school timings, students visit and uniform code and ensure short duration visit of students, the notification said.Elementary school teachers are to attend schools as per their roster duty chart developed by the school for compulsory transaction of daily or weekly lessons plans or worksheet accordingly via online or through parental distribution at the school campus, Wahlang said.Schools have been asked to develop individual micro planning relating to flexibility in school timings, the scheduling of students visit and uniform code, he said.The notification said that all schools should prepare a Continuous Learning Plan (CLP) to ensure all students are learning, continue online or distance learning modes and develop a 50 per cent attendance of teaching and non-teaching staff.The department has laid strict emphasis on compliance of health protocols, such as maintaining physical distance, wearing masks, washing hands with soap and alcohol-based hand sanitisers and sanitising all teaching materials.
Karnataka BJP chief Nalin Kumar Kateel wants all pubs in Dakshina Kannada district to be shut down, as the pub culture is ruining youngsters, the BJP state chief said. Mangalore, Bantwal, Puttur, Sullia, Belthangady, Kadaba and Moodabidri talukas fall under Dakshina Kannada district.Saying that he has already talked with the commissioner on this issues, the BJP chief said, “In our time, we stopped the operation of clubs. Pubs should also be shut down in the district. It is ruining youngsters. If the government doesn’t take any decision, I will inform the youth wing (party) to take appropriate action through court.”The controversy over Karnataka’s pub and club culture goes back to 2009 when BS Yediyurappa was the chief minister and his government strongly opposed to the growing pub culture in districts surrounding Bengaluru at that time — in the aftermath of Mangalore pub attack. On January 24, 2009, Sri Ram Sena attacked a group of young crowd in a pub in Mangalore. Those who had been arrested were acquitted in 2018.

Covid-19 is the biggest challenge that the global tourism sector has faced till date. The United Nations World Tourism Organization estimates a reduction of 58% to 78% in tourist traffic across the world. This means that international tourist arrivals could drop by a billion. Typically, the tourism sector is among the first to be affected, and the last to recover during a health crisis.For the tourism sector in India, it is no longer going to be business-as-usual and we will need to redefine, refocus and change the game plan going forward. It is essential to measure the impact of Covid-19 and prepare a cogent strategy involving both the government and the industry stakeholders, which can be categorised into three phases: Survive (short-term), revive (medium-term) and thrive (long-term).The twin challenges in the survive stage are to save businesses and save jobs. The Centre must provide businesses with institutional access to working capital and enable liquidity through a deferment of loan repayments. The Centre intends to help small businesses to access working capital by underwriting a part of the loan amount.On the demand side, India has a robust domestic market which could soften the impact as compared with nations that rely largely on international tourists. India receives 11 million foreign tourists, which is small compared to its size and relative potential. Dubai receives well over 16 million tourists. At least 24 million Indian tourists travel abroad each year and spend an estimated $25 billion. We must incentivise domestic travel to retain these high- spending tourists, which should not be difficult given the international travel restrictions in place. Critical to the success of this would be to allay the anxieties of tourists by ensuring that robust protocols for safety and hygiene are in place.In the revive phase, the slow easing of international travel restrictions will result in intense competition as all countries will target the same markets. This calls for a nimble and aggressive strategy for specific micro-markets focused on intense localised communication through social media.We need to prioritise products and destinations that would be of interest in the target market and ensure that these deliver value for money.Even though a significant part of the business travel will be lost to technology, India should aggressively campaign with state support to host a handful of the biggest and best global conferences and conventions to send out the message that India is safe and is back in business.The thrive phase calls for an adaptation to a fundamentally changed tourism sector post-Covid-19.Consumer preferences and tourism policies the world over are expected to evolve towards achieving greater sustainability and community orientation.We will see a trend towards taking cognisance of environmental costs beyond economic costs; destinations that will move towards a zero carbon foot print along with higher levels of hygiene; tour operators and hoteliers gravitating towards more responsible and meaningful experiences through minimising food miles; showcasing the local for the global; and positioning the host community as the centrepiece of the tourist experience.The pandemic offers us an opportunity to hit the reset the button to make the tourism sector a sustainable engine for economic growth and development.Beyond the immediate pain of the pandemic, we should not miss the chance to make full use of the crisis.Suman Billa is an IAS officer of the Kerala cadre currently posted as director, technical cooperation in the United Nations World Tourism Organization at MadridThe views expressed are personal
Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday requested all non-BJP parties to oppose the three Bills related to the agriculture sector introduced by the Centre in the Rajya Sabha.“The three Bills of the Centre will leave the farmers for exploitation in the hands of big companies. I request all non-BJP parties to oppose the Bill unanimously in the Rajya Sabha. It must be ensured that all MPs are present and there should be no drama of walkout. The farmers of the country are watching you,” he said in a tweet (Roughly translated from Hindi).Kejriwal on Thursday said that the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) will vote against the three bills on agriculture in the Parliament.In a tweet in Hindi, Kejriwal had said, “Three laws which have been brought into Parliament related to agriculture and farmers are against the farmers. The farmers are opposing it throughout the country. The Central government should take back these three laws. The Aam Aadmi Party will vote against them in Parliament.”Farmers in Punjab, Haryana have been protesting against the agriculture ordinances passed by the Union Cabinet. The three Bills to replace the ordinances were introduced in the Lok Sabha in the monsoon session and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020 was passed on Tuesday.
Updated: Sep 15, 2020 08:24 ISTOracle Corp confirmed on Monday that it was part of a proposal made by TikTok-parent ByteDance to the U.S. government to become a technology partner for the Chinese firm.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said earlier in the day that the Trump administration received a proposal from Oracle over the weekend to make Chinese-owned short video app TikTok a U.S.-headquartered company and will review the plan this week.
Actor Chris Evans, who inadvertently posted a private picture on social media over the weekend, has thanked his fans for supporting him throught the ‘embarrassing situation’. The actor had shared a video on Instagram, which briefly revealed a glimpse of his camera roll, which contained the picture in question.“Look, it was a very interesting weekend, full of lessons learned,” the Captain America actor said on the Tamron Hall show. “You know, things happen. It’s embarrassing but you gotta roll with the punches. I will say, I have some pretty fantastic fans who really came to my support. That was really, really nice.”Now that I have your attention🤦🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️....VOTE Nov 3rd!!! — Chris Evans (@ChrisEvans) September 15, 2020The post was deleted quickly, but not before six million followers had been exposed to it. But the actors friends and fans were quick to support him. Mark Ruffalo, his co-star in the Marvel movies, tweeted, “Bro, while Trump is in office there is NOTHING you could possibly do to embarrass yourself. See... silver lining.” Actor Jameela Jamil wrote, “You did it for your country.” Meanwhile, Evans’ brother, actor Scott Evans wrote on Twitter, “Was off social media for the day yesterday. So. What’d I miss?”Even Evans seemed to have taken the gaffe in his stride. His first tweet post the incident was, “Now that I have your attention... VOTE Nov 3rd.” Jamie Lee Curtis, who worked with Evans on Knives Out, wrote in response, “My boy! Proud of him. Got MY attention!”Chris Evans ended his Marvel journey with 2019’s Avengers: Endgame, in which Captain America was given a fitting sendoff. The actor recently made his television starring debut with the Apple TV+ series Defending Jacob, and was recently announced to have joined the cast of The Gray Man, touted as the most expensive Netflix original film, directed by Joe and Anthony Russo, and co-starring Ryan Gosling.
The Mamata Banerjee administration in West Bengal has cancelled the lockdown on September 12 keeping in mind the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test that is scheduled a day after.“GoWB had initially announced a statewide lockdown on Sep 11th & 12th.

US President Donald Trump on Monday vowed that any attack by Iran would be met with a response “1,000 times greater in magnitude,” after reports that Iran planned to avenge the killing of top general Qasem Soleimani.A US media report, quoting unnamed officials, said that an alleged Iranian plot to assassinate the US ambassador to South Africa was planned before the presidential election in November.“According to press reports, Iran may be planning an assassination, or other attack, against the United States in retaliation for the killing of terrorist leader Soleimani,” Trump tweeted.“Any attack by Iran, in any form, against the United States will be met with an attack on Iran that will be 1,000 times greater in magnitude!”Relations between Washington and Tehran have been tense since the Iranian revolution, and have spiralled since Trump unilaterally pulled out of a landmark international nuclear deal with Iran in May 2018.In January, a US drone strike killed Soleimani in Baghdad, and Washington is pushing to extend an arms embargo on Iran that starts to progressively expire in October as well as reimposing UN sanctions on the Islamic republic.- Iran denies plot -Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday declined to comment directly on the reported threat to Lana Marks, the US ambassador to South Africa who is a close ally of Trump.But Pompeo told Fox News that “the Islamic Republic of Iran has engaged in assassination efforts all across the world. They have assassinated people in Europe and in other parts of the world. We take these... allegations seriously.“We make very clear to the Islamic Republic of Iran that this kind of activity -- attacking any American any place at any time, whether it’s an American diplomat, an ambassador, or one of our service members -- is completely unacceptable.”The Iranian foreign ministry spokesman on Monday dismissed the report of an assassination plot as “baseless” and part of “repetitive and rotten methods to create an anti-Iranian atmosphere on the international stage.”The Iranian navy last week said it drove off American aircraft that flew close to an area where military exercises were underway near the Strait of Hormuz.The military said three US aircraft were detected by Iran’s air force radars after they entered the country’s air defence identification zone.In June last year, a US RQ-4 drone was shot down by Iran after allegedly violating Iranian airspace -- a claim the US has denied.
Independent India turns 75 on August 15, 2022 (it will celebrate its 76th Independence Day then). In September 2007, at the India@60 event in New York, the late management guru, CK Prahalad, delivered a talk on his vision for India at 75.Prahalad’s vision was notable simply because it was specific (and few visions are). His wish-list was long: A 10% share of global trade; a base of 200 million college graduates and 500 million certified technical workers; being home to at least 30 Fortune 100 companies; becoming a hub for innovation, including innovation at what Prahalad called the bottom of the pyramid; 500 world class cities; and a new deal for agriculture that took productivity to global standards. There was more — “a flowering of arts, science and literature” and becoming a global “benchmark” for its inclusivity and ability to “accept and benefit from its diversity.”India turned 73 on Saturday, and it is worth measuring its achievements on each of the items in Prahalad’s list.On most, India is a distance away from meeting the targets enumerated 13 years ago, and as much as the coronavirus pandemic has disrupted lives and work, it can’t be blamed for that. Misdirected policies and poor implementation are to blame, but the chasm between where we are now and where Prahalad thought we should be in 2022 is due more to a collective failure than an individual one.The pandemic, which has infected 21.3 million people and killed over 750,000 of them globally, and infected 2.5 million people (killing close to 50,000) in India, has turned everyone’s focus on the short-term (the very short-term), which is understandable. But even as a country copes with the immediate challenges posed by the viral disease, it needs to plan for the future, even if only the medium-term. That is exactly what India has to do when it comes to the economy.Covid-19 has ravaged the economy. The consensus among economists is that the Indian economy will shrink by at least 5% in 2020-21, and that it will not recover enough in 2021-22 to make up for these losses. In effect, India could, in 2022, when it celebrates 75 years of Independence, have an economy that is smaller than what it did in 2019-20.Over the past five months, people have lost jobs or suffered salary cuts; many small businesses have closed down and many businesspeople have gone out of work; entire supply chains have been disrupted; and consumer confidence is down. These are the immediate challenges the government has to address — and the only way to do so is a healthy fiscal stimulus with a large cash component. Larger discussions about the long-term wisdom of the measure can wait — India should just buy its way out of this mess.Even as it does, though, India should, with the learnings from the pandemic and the quality of its response to what would definitely qualify as a Black Swan event, tailor its long-term response. There are many elements to this but Chanakya would like to focus on four.One, India should create a bad bank. This was being discussed even before the pandemic, but given that many more borrowers are going to find it difficult to repay their loans (no matter how lenient the central bank gets) because of the pandemic, a bad bank may well be the cleanest way to protect the rest of the financial system from bad loans.Two, India should focus on public health. Covid-19 has shown up inadequacies in the health care system that need to be addressed. Spending on health could well create a virtuous cycle. Better still, the benefits between health and productivity are well-established. How much should India spend on this? At least 4-5% of its Gross Domestic Product for the next decade.Three, it needs to rethink its approach to manufacturing in light of the learnings from Covid-19. In areas of strategic importance, the country has to develop intellectual property and manufacturing expertise — but the government has to get innovative about this. For instance, would it be possible to encourage businesses to invest in the Indian hinterland, by providing land, tax-breaks, and easier labour laws (that still protect the interests of workers)? This may also ensure that jobs are created where the people are — preventing mass migration of workers, especially from populous-but-backward states in north and east India. There have been some efforts in this direction, but no results so far.Four, India has to get its cities right. It isn’t a coincidence that the first major Covid-19 hotspots in the country were Delhi, Mumbai, and Chennai. Other cities — Ahmedabad, Indore, and Jaipur — also saw clusters of infections. And as this piece is being written, the pandemic is roiling Bengaluru. From the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission to the Smart Cities scheme, India has always had plans for its urban centres, yet no real progress seems to have been made. A concerted effort at urban renewal wouldn’t just give Indians cities where they can live well and work well, but also spur large-scale infrastructure projects (from housing to transport) that may just prime the pump.India will not achieve Prahalad’s targets when it turns 75. But it is time for it to get its short-term and medium-term objectives and roadmap right for the economic story to be back on track by 2022.letters@hindustantimes.com
Maharashtra’s ruling Shiv Sena has asked the Centre to take a loan from the World Bank to help states while blaming it for the country’s “collapsed” economy, mishandling the Covid-19 lockdown and causing “chaos and uncertainty”. In an editorial in its mouthpiece Saamana, the Shiv Sena said the Centre must give financial aid to states to help them tide over the economic crisis as states fill up the coffers of the central government.“The Centre is responsible for the collapse of the economy. Fatal experiments like demonetisation [withdrawal of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 banknotes in 2016] are responsible for the chaos in the economy. Without any preparation [a countrywide] lockdown was announced, and while doing so there was no coordination...,” the editorial said.It added Union health minister Harsh Vardhan said on March 13 there is no medical emergency in the country. “On March 22, Prime Minister called for [voluntary] Janata curfew [for social distancing]. On March 24, after a notice of only four hours, a 21-day strict lockdown was announced. The chaos and uncertainty that started then is still going on. Never has there been so much chaos.”The editorial said states like Punjab, Delhi and West Bengal have sought financial assistance from the Centre. It added revenues of states such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar have reduced by 75%. The editorial asked the Centre to take a “hefty loan” from the World Bank and distribute money to the states while calling it the “only alternative”. It noted the Centre announced a relief package of Rs 20 lakh crore during the lockdown and added “it is a mystery where the money has gone”.The editorial said at least 22% of the Centre’s revenue comes from Mumbai, but it is not ready to help states. “Maharashtra, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Delhi have borne the maximum brunt of Covid-19 and suffered losses worth Rs 14.4 lakh crore,” the editorial said.The Centre late last month offered the states two borrowing options to plug a shortfall in their Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue, estimated at Rs 2.35 lakh crore in the current financial year, as the Covid-19 pandemic has taken a toll on the economy. The states can borrow Rs 97,000 crore at a reasonable interest rate and repay the amount from the cess charged on luxury and sin goods like liquor after the GST regime completes five years of implementation in June 2022. The second option is for the states to borrow the entire Rs 2.35 lakh crore in consultation with the central bank. Some states have insisted that the Centre borrow the money instead and compensate the states for the shortfall.
I am not surprised by the increasing coverage of Bihar politics these days. After all, if the elections are on time, the state will be voting in about two months. What does, however, perplex me is the silence on West Bengal. Elections there may be nine months away, but they’ll certainly be both a cliffhanger and seminal. In fact, to use a woke phrase, they’re bound to be a game-changer.On the surface, it’ll be a fight between Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress (TMC) and Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). At its heart, however, this is a struggle for supremacy between two conflicting visions of India: Hindutva versus secularism. Bengal is the ground on which perhaps the most serious battle between these conflicting political forces is likely to happen.The BJP goes into this fight with considerable advantages. It has unparalleled access to financial resources. The TMC simply cannot compete. So, if it’s a virtual campaign, Mamata is likely to be at a significant disadvantage. Second, the Centre has the power to dismiss Mamata’s government if it wants and, in addition, a governor who would have no hesitation recommending such a course of action. Mamata has frequently riled both and will, no doubt, continue to do so. That could be provocation enough. Third, the BJP can command its nationwide leadership to campaign and canvass. In a tight contest that is not to be sniffed at. Mamata only has what she’s got in Bengal. I’m not sure how much help regional political leaders could be. They don’t count in Bengal and they might not want to offend the BJP either.Mamata and the TMC also have to contend with Congress and the Communists. No doubt, they are shrunken forces but whatever support they retain in Bengal is likely to be at Mamata’s cost. They may be political flies compared to the BJP’s roaring tiger, but any time she spends swatting them away will detract from her focus on her main opponent.Now, consider what a BJP victory in Bengal would amount to. It won’t be just another state for Narendra Modi. Bengal’s demography and politics suggest it will be much more than that. First, it’s a state with 27% Muslims. Only Assam has more. If Modi can win both, the Hindutva juggernaut will seem unstoppable.Then there’s the politics of Bengal. This is a state which for nearly 35 years was under unbroken and unchallenged Communist rule. Since 2011, it’s been controlled by the toughest opponent Modi has had to face. No one has challenged him more than Mamata. Their rivalry is not just political, it’s personal. Therefore, a BJP victory would herald a seismic shift.The fall of Calcutta-Kolkata — if it happens — could be compared to the conquest of Carthage and Constantinople or, if you prefer, the Communist takeover of China in 1949. Nothing will be the same again. If Modi and the BJP can win Bengal, they will seem unshakeable and their spread irresistible whilst the Opposition would be crushed and humiliated.So, for the first time after 1911, Kolkata will be the cynosure of all eyes. The fight for Writer’s Building could seal the political future of the country.This is why we need to be better informed about the “Battle for Bharat” that looms ahead. The next nine months aren’t going to be easy for Mamata. Under emotional pressure she can make mistakes. Even when she was riding high, she wasn’t free of faults.Now, as she readies herself to face the formidable forces Modi can muster, the only powerful weapon in her armoury is possibly Prashant Kishor. He’s a political magician. Of that, I have no doubt. But can he pull it off yet again? He did it for Narendra Modi in 2014, Nitish Kumar in 2015, Amarinder Singh in 2017, Jaganmohan Reddy in 2019 and Arvind Kejriwal in 2020. They added feathers to his already crowded cap. Uttar Pradesh in 2017 was the solitary exception. Will Bengal be the second one?Karan Thapar is the author of Devil’s Advocate: The Untold StoryThe views expressed are personal

We all are making efforts for adapting to the ‘new normal’. In school education, the virtual classrooms have been the most effective tool in ensuring that the learning continues during the ongoing pandemic situation. Along with curricular activities, co-curricular activities are very important for social-emotional development. Therefore, students are introduced to different avenues for holistic learning. Staying connected and managing stress is a challenge faced by pupils and parents alike. It is necessary that one takes up some hobby or DIY activity to de-stress. And we can do a lot even while staying indoors.Technology has indeed revolutionised our lives. We can experiment in the kitchen or learn a language with any smart device. Young children also look for different avenues to break the monotony of routine. It is important that their creative pursuits are supported and their energy is channelised towards a positive goal. At SR DAV emphasis is on bolstering the curricular programme with life skills education.Also Read: HT Codeathon: Coding turned into child’s play, here’s how you can participateAnd, for a digital age learner, being adept in the latest in the technology is a necessary life skill.

The Chennai Super Kings will be looking for someone to fill Suresh Raina’s boots in the batting department at the Indian Premier League 2020. Raina is IPL’s second-highest run-scorer ever and has been an integral part of CSK’s team set-up for several years. This year he is set to miss out after travelling back home from UAE due to some personal reasons.Raina has often steadied the ship for CSK in the past when they were in a precarious position while also providing impetus to the innings with his stroke-fill batting. CSK would be hopeful of someone to step up to the task in the 13th season of the IPL.Former India batsman K Srikkanth believes it is the ideal opportunity for Murali Vijay to redeem himself in the IPL. Vijay returned to CSK in 2018 after turning out for other teams like KXIP and Delhi Daredevils. Srikkanth says he could be the one to take Raina’s place in the batting department.READ | Brother, this is not U19 cricket: Virat Kohli’s teammate Tanmay Srivastava reveals sledging incident in Ranji after World Cup success“See, in my opinion, it’s a good opportunity for Vijay. He is determined. Whenever we met, he says he has been practising well and looking for opportunities to do well,” Srikkanth said in his YouTube show ‘Cheeky Cheeka’“Don’t forget, Vijay is a big-match player, he can open with Shane Watson. it’s a great opportunity for him to redeem himself in the IPL. He has led sides like KXIP. Having played at that level, he would be keen to redeem himself.”“I still believe this team is a good team. They will definitely reach the top 4. CSK have the experience. The overall strength of CSK is MS Dhoni leading and experience. Dhoni knows the formula of winning,” Srikkanth said.Watson also talked about Raina’s departure, stating it would be hard to replace the batsman in the upcoming season due to his phenomenal record in the IPL. But he also feels Vijay is a capable batsman who has what it takes to perform for CSK in the UAE.“No doubt he [Raina] is a big loss but we have got someone like Murali Vijay, who is a gun player. In T20 cricket, he has not got a lot of opportunities in the last few years. But he is a seriously good batsman. He was sitting on the sidelines last year, he might get more opportunities this year,” said Watson.
In television newsrooms, the Ram mandir bhoomi pujan on August 5 was a grand spectacle where a religious epic met a modern-day political supremo. As multiple cameras tracked every move of Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi with breathless excitement, I must confess to switching off from the frenzy. My mind instead was rewinding to another big news day. For long before August 5, 2020, there was December 6, 1992.It was a Sunday and I was playing a cricket match in the genteel environs of the Bombay Gymkhana when the news trickled in around noon that the Babri masjid had been demolished in Ayodhya. Abandoning the game mid-way, I rushed to work. This was a pre-24x7 breaking news television era and our somnolent newspaper office in Mumbai seemed another universe away from the happenings in the temple town.It was only late evening as the images of the demolition were telecast on BBC that there was a marked shift in mood. That night, we got the first reports of stone-throwing near Minara masjid in the congested by-lanes of Bhendi Bazaar. A police wireless van had been attacked by a mob: The men in khakhi were seen as a symbol of government authority which had failed to protect the mosque. By midnight, there was visible tension in the air. Policemen were patrolling the streets even as the stone-throwing continued in some parts. The next day, the local Muslim League called a bandh, and a curfew was declared in central Mumbai even as the violence spread to the suburbs. For the next three months, Mumbai would be shaken out of its cosmopolitan illusions. A riot that began in December between the police and angry Muslim groups would transform in January into aggressive street mobilisation by militant Hindu outfits and culminate in March 1993 in serial blasts triggered by the Dawood Ibrahim-led underworld.For an archetypal south Mumbai child of relative privilege, the riots and terror attack were a wake-up call. Under the city of gold lurked an underbelly of grime, an overcrowded metropolis that was sitting on a combustible tinderbox. The Babri demolition had exposed Mumbai’s fault-lines and left the city at the mercy of resentful Muslim groups, Shiv Sena storm troopers, underworld gangs and a partisan police force. Outside my south Mumbai comfort zone, I was exposed to another Mumbai. We met dozens of families who were caught in the crossfire, forced to abandon their homes and flee, others whose shops and offices had been burnt down. More than 1,000 people died in Mumbai’s twin riots and blasts, a majority of them faceless, innocent citizens targeted for their religious identity.In late 1993, as an eyewitness to the carnage, I deposed before the Justice Srikrishna Commission that was appointed to inquire into the Mumbai violence. The cross-examination went on for three days. A tough Shiv Sena lawyer and Member of Parliament (MP), Adhik Shirodkar, was unbending in his interrogation. At the Mumbai reporting team of The Times of India, we even compiled a book, When Bombay Burned, detailing the chain of bloody events that had traumatised the city. Publishing was still in infancy and only around 1,000 copies of the book were printed. It was easily the most harrowing, gut-wrenching year in my professional life — a city that I loved dearly had been scarred, perhaps forever. Mumbai was sharply divided on communal lines. A Hindu-Muslim physical and psychological fracture occurred in those months that has never quite healed.Twenty-eight years later, the wheel has come full circle. Here we are in a new, distinctly polarised India, where majoritarian politics is now mainstream, where the lines between secular and communal, law and illegality have been conveniently erased. The Shiv Sena, whose leader Bal Thackeray claimed in 1992 to be “proud of his boys” for their role in the demolition, is now the party in power in Maharashtra with the Congress as a junior ally. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), for which the Ayodhya movement was the passport to political influence, is now the country’s dominant political formation. Narendra Modi who earned his spurs while organising the 1990 Ram Janmabhoomi rath yatra that gained momentum and eventually led to the masjid’sdemolition is now the country’s all-powerful leader. The Indian Muslim is a fearful, marginal voice, ghettoised and demonised as the permanent other.The law has failed to take its course. A majority of the 2,000 odd cases that were registered in connection with the Mumbai riots have been closed. There have been a handful of convictions, but most of the accused are out on bail. The Srikrishna report, which indicted the Sena and Mumbai police officers, was never acted upon and eventually dumped by the Maharashtra government. The Babri masjid demolition trial is still going on in a special court in Lucknow with no convictions. The high-profile politicians named in an FIR are now part of the power elite. No one who suffered in the post-Babri violence can claim to have got any justice or closure from a compromised State machinery.As for me, I remain haunted by the images of rioting and destruction, of the smoke-filled skies of a city’s social fabric being torn apart, of tearful Mumbaikars with their agonising stories of despair. The PM may have likened August 5 to the freedom movement but the festivities of the mandir nirman will always remind me of December 6, the day when vandalism triumphed over the Constitution and violence over ahimsa.Postscript: My children are the post-Babri generation, born years after the demolition and, like millions of millennials, with no link to the past. Maybe, one day, they will read our Mumbai riots book, if only to realise that the foundation of a shiny new India has been built on the debris of a bloodied old order.Rajdeep Sardesai is a senior journalist and authorThe views expressed are personal
The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 lays emphasis on the research and innovation through various means, Union minister Prakash Javadekar said here on Tuesday.He listed affordability, accessibility, quality, equity, and accountability as the five pillars of the NEP, and also mentioned about introducing a new dimension of flexibility through choice-based education.“The National Education Policy 2020 gives emphasis to research and innovation by increasing the expenditure on research; organising more hackathons for students, and by encouraging a dialogue between academia, industry and research lab,” the Information and Broadcasting Minister said.He was speaking on the NEP 2020 at a programme here.Javadekar mentioned concepts such as the “Bank of Credit to facilitate smoother transfer between institutions.He said the Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER) will be increased from 26 per cent to 50 per cent in the next 15 years.The GER is a statistical measure used in the education sector to determine the number of students enrolled in school at several different grade levels. It is used to show the ratio of the number of students who live in a given country to those who qualify for the particular grade level.

Shaheen Bhatt reflected on her use of social media after watching the new Netflix documentary, The Social Dilemma, which explores the dangers of social networking. In a series of musings posted on her Instagram stories, she said that she came to the epiphany that her use of social media ‘rarely comes from positive feelings’. However, she expressed her desire to change that.“Just like anyone who’s watched the Social Dilemma - I’ve been thinking a lot about how/why I use social media. I did some thinking and realised my use of social media rarely comes from positive feelings,” she wrote.“On the contrary, my use of social media usually comes from an anxious, connection-hampering place,” Shaheen wrote. She also shared hand-written observations, in which she wrote that social media not only preys on but enhances her insecurity, suggestibility, boredom, loneliness and FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out).Shaheen expressed her desire to ‘change all that’ and said that she would like to use social media for displaying work, sharing passions, getting ideas/inspiration, forging new connections and surprises.Shaheen shared a graph of her weekly usage of Instagram, which showed that she spent an average of 53 minutes per day on the photo-sharing platform, in the last week. “I spent more time here than I should have this week,” she wrote, adding that the longest she spent was an hour and 40 minutes, which was before watching The Social Dilemma.The least time Shaheen spent in a day scrolling through Instagram this week was 22 minutes, which she said was ‘more my idea of controlled social media use’.In July, Shaheen shared screenshots of hate messages received by her in the aftermath of Sushant Singh Rajput’s death. She threatened to take legal actions against trolls sending her abusive messages.Shaheen had written in her Instagram stories, “I speak now to those of you who think it’s okay to send me or anyone messages full of hate: If you send me a message with the sole hope (I say hope because I promise you -nothing you say is keeping me up at night) of humiliating, insulting, or bullying me, then the following things will happen: - The messages or comments will first be blocked and reported to Instagram directly. - You will forfeit the right to your privacy. I will NOT protect your identity. Every sh**ty message you send me will - should I choose to - go up for everyone to see. Abusers are emboldened by their anonymity. I will not help hide you. - I WILL use all legal recourse available to me to take action. If you think you can’t be located because your account is anonymous, please think again - IP addresses are easily trackable. You are not invisible. Harassment is a crime.”
Television personality Malaika Arora, who tested positive for the coronavirus recently, has shared a post about not being able to hug her son, Arhaan.

With our social distancing and self quarantine in place, we still find a way to check on each other, see each other and talk. While my heart breaks to not be able to hug my two babies for another few days, just looking at their sweet faces gives me so much courage and energy to power through....” Malaika’s post has been ‘liked’ over 130000 times, and has drawn words of encouragement from her friends and family.Her sister, Amrita Arora wrote in the comments section, “Love this pic malla Lots of hugging for all of us…” Vidya Malvade wrote, “So much loveeeee to you Malla. God bless.” Bipasha Basu commented, “Yes yes yes. You are way too strong for this. Sending you love and healing everyday. Soon you will be able to hug your babies.”Sanjay Kapoor, Maheep Kapoor and Bhavana Pandey left heart emojis in the comments section, and Dia Mirza wrote, “Sending you lots of love and a BIG hug.”Malaika and her boyfriend, Arjun Kapoor, both recently tested positive for Covid-19. She had returned as a judge on the reality show India’s Best Dancer, the shoot of which has reportedly been halted. In her statement, posted on Instagram, Malaika had written, “Today I have tested positive for coronavirus but I want to inform you all that I am feeling fine.” She added, “I am asymptomatic and following all the required protocols and will be quarantined at home as instructed by my doctor and authorities. I request all of you to stay calm and safe. Thank you for all your support . Much love.”
Former India fast bowler Munaf Patel and West Indies cricketers Chris Gayle and Daren Sammy are among the 150-odd overseas players to go under the hammer for the inaugural Lanka Premier League auction to be held on October 1.Former Pakistan all-rounder Shahid Afridi, Bangladesh star Shakib Al Hasan, West Indies batsman Darren Bravo, England’s Ravi Bopara, Colin Munro of New Zealand and South Africa’s Vernon Philander have also been included for the auction.Five franchises will play in the inaugural edition of LPL which is scheduled to run from November 14 to December 6. The tournament was to be held in August but postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) said in a statement.Patel, 37, retired from all forms of cricket in 2018 after playing in 13 Tests, 70 ODIs and three T20Is. He made his debut in 2006 and was a member of India’s 2011 World Cup-winning team. He had earlier played in the T10 League in the UAE.Each franchise can buy up to six international players. A total of 30 international cricketers and 65 local cricketers are expected to make up the five teams which will have 19 players each. The matches will be played in Dambulla, Pallekele and Hambantota international stadiums. The LPL launch will be held in Hambantota.However, the Sri Lankan government is yet to give approval for a shorter quarantine period for players, officials and broadcast staff. It is this hurdle that had forced the postponement of the LPL, originally slated to begin in late August.The SLC officials have asked for a shorter quarantine period of seven days for those arriving in the country for this tournament, from the present 14-day period. Quarantine protocols in Sri Lanka are very strict in order to prevent the spread of the virus.
The Dubai Civil Aviation Authority (DCAA) has suspended Air India Express flights between India and Dubai, the United Arab Emirates’ (UAE) biggest city, from Friday until October 2.The flights have been temporarily barred because a passenger on a recent Jaipur-Dubai flight operated by Air India Express, the low-cost airline of the national carrier Air India, was found to be coronavirus disease (Covid-19) positive by the DCAA authorities. This was the second time the airline flew an infected passenger.The DCAA has sent a notice to Air India Express. The notice stated that the flight IX1135 operated by the airline from Jaipur to Dubai International Airport (DIA), had a passenger on board, who had contracted SARS-CoV-2 that causes Covid-19.The notice is in HT’s possession.Also Read: Covid-19: Airlines offer schemes to boost passenger confidence“You are aware of our previous intimation made to you by our letter dated September 2 for boarding a passenger with a Covid-19 positive test result, who endangered the other passengers on board and also caused a serious health risk.Boarding a passenger with Covid-19 positive test result for the second time is contrary to and is in violation of the laid-down procedures and protocols relating to air travel to and from airports in the Emirate of Dubai during the pandemic,” stated the notice.The notice has led to the temporary suspension of all Air India Express flights to Dubai for the next 15 days.Also Read: Parliament monsoon session: Aircraft (Amendment) Bill passed by Rajya Sabha“This (suspension) has been effective from 00:00 hours on Friday, September 18, until 23:59 hours of October 2,” the notice added.“Air India Express has received the ‘Notice of Suspension’ from Dubai Civil Aviation Authority on September 17, 2020, as per which the airline’s operations to Dubai airport are temporarily suspended for a duration of 15 days w.e.f September 18, 2020.The Notice has been issued on account of the erroneous acceptance of one Covid-19 positive passenger by the airline’s ground handling agents at Delhi and Jaipur on Air India Express flights to Dubai on August 28 and September 4 respectively,” said an airline spokesperson.“Passengers who were seated in close proximity to the Covid-19 positive passenger on each flight have undergone a Covid-19 test / been quarantined as determined by the Dubai health authority.

The affected passengers who have booked to fly to Dubai are also being given the option to re-book to a future date.
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has pledged to rejoin the historic Paris Agreement on climate change, if elected to power in the November presidential election, and set new standards towards reducing carbon emissions.Claiming that the 2015 Paris climate deal puts an “unfair economic burden” on Americans, president Donald Trump’s administration notified the United Nations in November last year that the US would withdraw from the agreement. The notification begins a one-year process of exiting the global climate change accord, culminating the day after the 2020 US election on November 3.“While he (President Donald Trump) turned against our allies, I’ll bring us back into the Paris Agreement. I will put us back in the business of leading the world on climate change and I will challenge every other country to up the ante on climate commitments,” Biden said in a major policy speech on climate change.“Where he reverses the Obama-Biden fuel efficiency standards, he picks big oil. He picks in big oil companies over American workers, even when the automobile industry agreed,” he said in his address from Delaware.Biden is challenging Trump, a Republican, in the November 3 US presidential election. Trump, who has made withdrawing from the climate agreement one of his election campaign pledges, has said the deal “punished” the US and would cost millions of American jobs.However, Trump has also indicated he was open to another climate deal “on terms that are fair to the United States”.The Paris accord committed the US and 187 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures below 2C above pre-industrial levels and attempting to limit them even more, to a 1.5C rise.The decision by the US - one of the world’s biggest emitters of greenhouse gases - has led to condemnation from environmentalists and expressions of regret from world leaders.Biden said, if elected, he will not only bring the standards back, but will also set new ambitious ones that American workers are ready to meet.“I’ll also see American workers building and installing 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations along our newly engaged infrastructure programs and highways all across the country. I see American consumers switching to electric vehicles through rebates and initiatives,” he said.“Not only that, the United States owns and maintains an enormous fleet of vehicles and we’re going to harness the purchasing power of our federal government to make sure we’re buying electric vehicles that are made and sourced by union workers right here in the United States of America. And together, this will mean more than a million new jobs in the American auto industry,” he asserted.Biden said he will put the US on a path to achieve a carbon pollution free electricity sector by 2035 that no future president can come along and turn back.Transforming the electrical sector power to produce power without carbon pollution will be the greatest spur to job creation and economic competitiveness in the 21st century, not to mention the positive benefits to health and the environment, he argued.“We need to get to work right away. We’ll need scientists at the national labs and land grant universities, historic black colleges and universities to improve and innovate technologies needed to generate, store, and transmit this clean electric. We need engineers to design and workers to manufacture these new products,” he said.Asserting that climate change is the existential challenge that’s going to determine America’s future as a country, Biden said that like the pandemic, dealing with climate change is a global crisis, and that requires American leadership.“It requires a president for all Americans. So, as the fires rage out West on this day, our prayers remain with everyone under the ash. I know it’s hard to see the sun rise believing today will be a better day than yesterday. Americans face this historic inflection point, a time of real peril but also a time of extraordinary possibilities,” he said. PTI LKJ ABH AKJ AKJ

Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a National Digital Health Mission in his Independence Day speech. It is an ambitious plan to create a digital infrastructure for health care delivery, which will include personal health IDs and e-records for citizens. This will greatly facilitate tele-medicine, e-pharmacy, and collection, consolidation and inter-operability of health data. This is welcome. At a recent roundtable organised by the Digital Identity Research Initiative (DIRI) at the Indian School of Business (ISB), health experts, entrepreneurs, academics and thought leaders discussed agreed that digitisation of health care in India is the future that we must embrace, with speed and with care.Personal data, especially health data, is sensitive, and its privacy must be protected. We now have the technology to ensure that happens. We can use Blockchain technology to guarantee that data that is created is encrypted and cannot be altered. Consent for accessing and storing individual data, in part or in whole, will stay with the individual and can be given to a trusted authority such as a physician, a pharmacy, a test laboratory or a research institution as necessary and deemed fit by the individual. So, for example, if you approach a doctor for a second opinion, you could allow the doctor to see the complete diagnosis and previous care provided. A test lab needs to only get the samples without the patient identifying information.Consent must also be taken to anonymise personal data so that it can be made part of a public data set. Hospitals and clinics can, and must, anonymise individual data before sharing it with others who may aggregate it to create useful indices. Some of these indices can be made public to help detect patterns and predict the onset of health crises before they actually arrive in full-force so that public health agencies can intervene appropriately to manage these. Anonymisation ensures that if you are diagnosed with tuberculosis, for example, no unauthorised person should be able to infer this from the data. Aggregation, on the other hand, will be able to alert public health officials, for example, that a given geographic region is showing a spike in cases and further investigation and intervention might be needed.Even the storage of aggregate data on cloud-servers need to be made hack-proof. First, the data that is stored must be encrypted. Second, the data must be distributed across several independent servers so that even if data is hacked and downloaded from one server, the original sensitive data cannot be recovered. Recent technological advances allow the creation of such a protocol. Third, the encrypted data should contain useful tags so that when it is downloaded with proper authentication and consent, only at the authorised level of aggregation, the data can be recovered for appropriate use. Again, recent advances in computer science allow, with a judicious use of symmetric and asymmetric private keys, retrieval that is fast and convenient using existing technology.The use of health data and related health care services must create a level-playing field that encourages free-entry and entrepreneurship by small and big players, both in the private and the public sector. Inter-operability and public-good features of the health data will facilitate competition and entrepreneurship.India is a large, growing country and its health care needs are immense. Advanced health care expertise is concentrated in large cities whereas a large population with health care needs is geographically distant from such expertise and facilities. Not everyone can get admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences at short notice not only because such capacity is limited but also because costs and time constraints prevent most from being able to access such care. Tele-medicine can alleviate these limitations to a great extent. If the patient cannot reach the right doctor or the right facilities, the doctor can reach the patient through tele-medicine and test-results can be communicated electronically with speed. Only a fraction of the patients would need to be moved to facilities far away from home, and while the patient travels, the diagnosis, some palliative care and tests can continue seamlessly without interruption.Many of the developed countries have created models of digital health with excess and waste, even as they reaped the benefits of digitisation. As India is embarking on an almost greenfield health care digitisation spree, we should take lessons from their experience — leapfrog for sure, but don’t commit similar infrastructural errors as this would be financially disastrous, given India’s scale. Hence it is imperative to have the veterans of industry, technology and business deploying needful and future-proof technologies in developing our model of digital health care.India is a unique country in many ways and the effective solution for our needs will have to be uniquely Indian. We must create an infrastructure that allows us to do this not only to meet our needs effectively and in a cost-effective manner, but also to create something that much of the rest of the world can emulate.Kris Gopalakrishnan is an IT and health care expert.

Online education startup Byju’s raised $500 million from a group of investors, including private equity firm Silver Lake Partners, sending the valuation of the company founded by a star math teacher from Kerala to nearly $11 billion.Existing investors Tiger Global, General Atlantic and Owl Ventures also participated in the investment round, Byju’s said in a note on Tuesday.The company, named after its founder Byju Raveendran, has raised around $1 billion since January, reflecting the surge in investor interest in Indian edtech startups as remote learning replaced classrooms amid the lockdown.Companies such as Byju’s are benefiting from the readiness of Indian middle-class families to spend a big chunk of their income on education and tutoring to give their children an edge amid rampant unemployment.The surge in investor interest has catapulted Byju’s into India’s second-most valuable startup, also earning it the decacorn status—the handful of startups that are valued at more than $10 billion.It’s not just Byju’s. The pandemic has also helped rival edtech startups sign up thousands of paying customers. Last week, Unacademy raised $150 million in a funding round led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2, tripling its valuation to $1.45 billion in just six months.The edtech segment is poised to get more attention from investors in the near future, according to Sanchit Vir Gogia, chief analyst and founder, Greyhound Research.“A large part of the customer base that Byju’s and Unacademy is targeting are still learners who don’t have access to smartphones, tablets and other gadgets. Edtech will turn into a larger market opportunity when it disrupts the core curriculum of schools and colleges,” Gogia said.In a May 19 interview, Raveendran, 39, said, “Covid has been an inflection point for education where screens have become the primary mode of content consumption for students. The ‘classrooms of tomorrow’ will have technology at its core.”On Tuesday, he said the crisis has brought online learning to the forefront. “Our classrooms are changing possibly for the first time in 100 years, and I’m excited about the opportunities we have to redefine the future of learning,” Raveendran said in a note.The new round values Byju’s at $10.8 billion, up from its last valuation at $10.5 billion from its earlier Series F round that closed in August.“This is a separate corporate round different from the earlier Series F round and there are more new international investors who are expected to fund Byju’s,” said a person familiar with the development.

There was no breach on part of the Mumbai police or the hospital when Bollywood actor Rhea Chakraborty visited the mortuary to see Sushant Singh Rajput’s body before the funeral, the Maharashtra State Human Rights Commission (MSHRC) ruled on Wednesday.The commission’s chairman MA Sayeed was quoted as saying by news agency ANI that it had looked into the matter based on media reports.MSHRC had sent a show-cause notice to the Dr RN Cooper Municipal General Hospital and the Mumbai police on August 25 for allowing Chakraborty and her family members to enter the mortuary when Rajput’s post-mortem was being conducted.Panel’s chief MA Sayeed had told a daily that he had asked the legal wing to look into the matter after he saw videos of Chakraborty visiting the mortuary. “We don’t know how and under what circumstances the permission to visit the mortuary was given. It should not have been so,” he was quoted as saying.Amid uproar on why Chakraborty was allowed access to the morgue, the 28-year-old actor had earlier told the media that she saw Rajput’s body for a few seconds as it was being transferred to the van from the mortuary for his funeral and touched his feet and apologised.The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is currently probing Rajput’s death on June 14, while the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) are investigating the money laundering and drug-related angle in the case.Rajout’s father KK Singh has filed an FIR against Chakraborty for driving his son to suicide.

The very process is used in other exams across the country to resolve similar issues.08:40 am IST JEE Main Result 2020 : What is the difference between percentile and percentage in scorecard Percentage is a number out of 100 while the percentile score of a candidate would reflect how many candidates have scored below that candidate in an exam. A Percentile score is the value below which a certain percent of observations fall. The percentile score would be based on the relative performance of all the aspirants appearing in the exam. The score would be obtained after transforming the scores into a scale ranging from 100 to 0 for each session of examinees.08:35 am IST JEE Main Result 2020: NTA scores of both attempts will be merged for result, here’s how The four NTA scores of each candidate’s first and second attempts would be merged for the compilation of JEE Main result and preparation of overall Merit List/Ranking.

The coronavirus crisis has pushed the Malaysian palm oil industry into a labour crunch so severe that it’s turning to prisoners for help.Producers of the tropical oil are reaching out to prison departments in search of locals for work in the palm industry that’s considered dirty, difficult and dangerous, according to the Malaysian Palm Oil Association, a growers’ group that represents 40% of the palm-planted area in the country.“Our prisons are quite overwhelmed,” the group’s chief executive Nageeb Wahab said by phone from Kuala Lumpur. There are thousands of people locked up for small offenses. “This is the target group that we’re looking at.”Malaysian palm growers have employed prisoners since 2016, Nageeb said, but the search is intensifying as the coronavirus exacerbates the labour shortage. Malaysia, the biggest grower after Indonesia, was already short of about 36,000 workers before the pandemic, he said. Now that’s risen significantly, which means the country may see up to a 30% loss in potential output.“The bullish prices experienced now cannot be fully exploited and this is going to be a big loss to both the industry and the government,” Nageeb said. Benchmark futures in Kuala Lumpur have surged almost 50% from their low in May.Read: Malaysia farms face $3 billion hit from palm oil worker shortageThe lack of workers has plagued Malaysian growers for years. Despite incentives like free housing, electricity and social amenities, locals shun the labour intensive process of harvesting palm fruit, pushing the industry to employ migrant workers from Indonesia, Bangladesh and India. Dependence on foreign labour is now more than 80%, according to Nageeb.But now, as lockdown policies restrict travel in many parts of the region, and the Malaysian government looks to cut back hiring of migrant workers, palm growers are left with little choice. The industry is also reaching out to drug rehabilitation centers for potential workers.Sime Darby Plantation Bhd., the world’s biggest oil palm planter by acreage, said on Wednesday it’s at risk of losing as many as 6,000 foreign workers this year as their contracts end, and has only managed to hire 300 locals. Intensive recruitment drives that began in July have mostly failed and the grower is now looking at prisons and drug rehabilitation centers for workers, according Chief Financial Officer Renaka Ramachandran.“Like never before, billboards have been erected at estates and mills, advertisements placed in the media, and intense engagement with the authorities to entice locals are done on a regular basis,” Nageeb said. “Response thus far has been lukewarm but we have not given up hope. In absence of any success, we may have to plead to the government for help.”
Harmony, security and self-reliance are a seamless whole. Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi drew these together during his Independence Day speech, a reminder that defence and foreign policy have unusual salience these days. The event, already muted by the pandemic, took place when much of the Northern Command has been mobilised, China has refused to restore the border status quo in Ladakh and the international system is in increasing disarray. It is no accident that PM spoke so much about the sacrifices of Indian soldiers, the defence measures the country is taking, and how much bigger the country’s international footprint has become.While never specifically mentioned, the centrality of the Chinese threat suffused much of the speech. Terrorism, and, therefore Pakistan, received an obligatory mention. The undermining of India’s territorial integrity, the soldiers killed in Ladakh, and the historical aside of India’s opposition to imperialism and “expansionism” were all messages addressed to Beijing. There has been a feeling that the Middle Kingdom does not understand the significance of what has happened on the Ladakh border and how much it threatens to distort bilateral relations. After this speech, China’s leadership has no reason to claim that it had no sense of the deepening hostility they have engendered in India.PM Modi made it a point to stress as to how much India’s standing has grown overseas. India was re-elected to the United Nations Security Council with a landslide vote. While the neighbourhood remains a concern, New Delhi has become a beneficiary of the changing geopolitics of West Asia with, for example, the recent bonding of two its regional friends, Israel and the United Arab Emirates. There was also a reminder of Southeast Asia’s importance. The idea of an “extended neighbourhood” that is connected by trust, land and sea sounds too broad to be meaningful. Yet, this is where India is going as it ratchets up new relationships across the world. PM Modi recognises that the question is how India reconciles all this with its current self-reliance framework. While it has laid out a reasonable indigenisation policy on defence, the task ahead will be an updated trade policy. India’s friends need to be reassured as to where New Delhi thinks economics fits into its extended neighbourhood.

Hong Kong stocks ended lower on Wednesday, dragged down by tech shares following a tech rout on the Wall Street.At the close of trade, the Hang Seng index was down 155.41 points or 0.63% at 24,468.93. The Hang Seng China Enterprises index fell 1.04% to 9,728.52.The sub-index of the Hang Seng tracking energy shares slipped 1.5%, while the IT sector slid 1.61%, the financial sector ended 0.66% lower and the property sector dipped 0.13%.The top gainer in the Hang Seng was Hong Kong and China Gas Co Ltd, which gained 2.5%, while the biggest loser was China Mengniu Dairy Co Ltd, which fell 3.99%.Tech shares led the declines. The Hang Seng tech index lost 1.5%, down for fifth session in a row.The Hang Seng index faced pressure as investors sold tech firms amid a U.S. selloff and persistent Sino-U.S. tensions, KGI Securities noted in report, adding the index could find support at 24,000 points.The brokerage noted limited room for a further rally in China’s domestic banks listed in Hong Kong given the heavy pressure from bad loans in coming quarters.On the mainland, China stocks dropped the most in six weeks on Wednesday.The major concerns are lofty valuations and the uncertainties around Sino-U.S. tensions, said Luo Kun, director of macro strategy center at Chasing Securities.Any major corrections in U.S. stock market, where there is a relative big tech bubble following stellar gains, would also put pressure on China’s start-up firms and wider tech players, Luo said.Around the region, MSCI’s Asia ex-Japan stock index was weaker by 0.33%, while Japan’s Nikkei index closed down 1.04%.The yuan was quoted at 6.8456 per U.S. dollar at 08:25 GMT, 0.02% firmer than the previous close of 6.847.
The knock-on effects of the coronavirus pandemic have halted and reversed global health progress, setting it back 25 years and exposing millions to the risk of deadly disease and poverty, a report by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation warned on Tuesday.Because of Covid-19, extreme poverty has increased by 7%, and routine vaccine coverage - a good proxy measure for how health systems are functioning - is dropping to levels last seen in the 1990s, the report said.“It’s a huge setback,” Bill Gates, co-chair of the Foundation and a leading philanthropic funder of global health and development, told a media briefing on the report’s findings.The Foundation’s Goalkeepers report, which tracks progress on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of reducing poverty and improving health, found that in the past year, by nearly every indicator, the world has regressed.Alongside dropping rates of routine immunisation, which the report described as “setting the world back about 25 years in 25 weeks”, rising levels of poverty and economic damage from the pandemic are reinforcing inequalities, it said.It found that the pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on women, racial and ethnic minority communities and people living in extreme poverty.“After 20 consecutive years of declines in extreme poverty, we’ve now seen a reversal,” said Mark Suzman, chief executive of the Gates Foundation, in an interview with Reuters. “We’ve had nearly 40 million people thrown back into extreme poverty. That’s well over a million a week since the virus hit.”The report cited International Monetary Fund projections that, despite the $18 trillion dollars already spent on trying to stimulate economies around the world, the global economy will lose $12 trillion or more by the end of 2021 - the biggest global GDP loss since the end of World War Two.While the scene is “bleak” right now, Gates said he was confident the world would emerge from the pandemic and resume progress towards the goals on improving global health.“Whether is takes us two years, or even three, we do believe that we’ll overcome this and get back on track,” he said.
Actor Ankita Lokhande on Monday tweeted to remind all that three months have passed since the tragic death of Sushant Singh Rajput. She mentioned how the late actor would always be in her thoughts.She wrote: “Time flies fast. Life goes on at its own pace. But some memories can never be forgotten of our dearest ones. You will always remain in our thoughts Sushant. #Justice4SSRIsGlobalDemand #itsalready3monthstoday @shwetasinghkirt @vikirti @jainvick.”Time flies fast .Life goes on at its own paceBut some memories can never be forgotten of our dearest ones.You will always remain in our thoughts Sushant . #Justice4SSRIsGlobalDemand #itsalready3monthstoday @shwetasinghkirt @vikirti @jainvick pic.twitter.com/Ij452X02Qk — Ankita lokhande (@anky1912) September 14, 2020Sushant died in Mumbai on June 14. Ankita, who dated Sushant for six years before their breakup in 2016, has put her weight behind the family of the late actor, demanding justice for him. The family had demanded a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) inquiry into the case, which eventually happened. In July this year, KK Singh, Sushant’s father, had filed an FIR in Patna, accusing Sushant’s then girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty of abetting his suicide, siphoning off funds and keeping him away from family. After days of silence, Rhea had refuted all the allegations, in interviews to a few news channels. Earlier this month, the actor was arrested on charges of procuring drugs for Sushant.Ankita’s passionate advocacy of Sushant’s family version of the case has landed her in trouble too. Some time last month, reports appeared that Sushant had been paying the EMIs for the flat that the two had bought when they were together. Ankita had refuted them and shared her bank account statements to show that the said EMIs were getting deducted from her account.Earlier this month, Ankita was criticised by VJ Shibani Dandekar for the actor’s stance on Rhea. Shibani had called Ankita a person wanting ‘2 seconds fame’. Ankita had replied saying that she was proud of being a TV actor, if that was the reason she was being run down.
At least 38 teachers and principals from CBSE affiliated schools were on Wednesday awarded for their contribution to school education by Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’.According to CBSE officials, the awards were presented for the year 2019-20 in honour of the teachers and principals for their valuable contribution towards improving school education, innovation and dedication.“Since 2018, CBSE follows an online selection process. The applicants are evaluated on the basis of general and specific criterion under each category and several parameters related to school education and their contribution,” a senior board official said.“The 38 awardees includes primary and middle level teachers, language teachers, science, social science, physical education, mathematics, economics, IT, fine arts teachers, school counsellors, vice principals and principals,” the official added.Each awardee received a merit certificate, a shawl and a cash prize of Rs 50,000.
The government has initiated a much-needed revolution in the schooling system through the New Education Policy to prepare students for the rapidly evolving digital landscape and global ecosystem.The new education policy emphasises on an experiential, integrated, student-focused, collaboration-based and analysis-driven pedagogy, aiming at holistic development of the child. Technology will play a huge role in achieving these objectives. To keep up with the digital transformation across the globe, educators and school principals must use technology as the key instrument to shape the future of our children.Let us discuss the key principles of the New Education Policy and how technology can assist educators in driving the implementation in each area:Encourage unique student capabilitiesAI can also point out tasks to educators where majority students face difficulties, so educators can work on improvement areas and make the classroom inclusive for all. It offers students ways to experiment and learn in a relatively judgment-free environment, providing personalized learning environments.Foster critical thinkingIncluding educational games for grammar exercises can increase student motivation and result in better retention. Educators can design creative, goal-oriented tasks which enhance students’ problem-solving abilities and promote innovative thinking.Integrating vocational learning at all levelsEducators can use simulations and make students work on vocational projects replicating real-life situations in the virtual world. Coding applications can be introduced in junior classes, to develop the technical acumenContinuous learningRecorded sessions would be very helpful for learners to cope up with the rest and educators would not be impacted by new joiners. Working students can continue their education through distance learning online programmes.Tracking individualised learning outcomesThrough real-time data analytics and the use of AI, educators can track individual progress effectively. They may also be able to analyse trends across the class and make appropriate interventions. Technology enables educators to shift towards competency-based assessments.Discovery-based teachingIntegration of technology helps link theory with practice and develop valuable, lifelong skills and strategies. For example, virtual labs for experimentation are now possible. Online technologies allow students to collaborate and share ideas and discoveries. Educators must emphasize conceptual understanding rather than rote learning. They can use 3D videos and models to explain difficult concepts, more tangibly and clearly and help students build stronger fundamentals.Empowering educatorsTechnology in the hands of great educators can be a life-changer for students. It enables educators to grow beyond linear, textbook-based learning and engage students meaningfully. Educators can prepare meticulous lesson plans through a plethora of online resources and educational websites - to enhance virtual learning experiences. It also gives educators a breather from routine administrative tasks that add little value to the quality of classroom instruction. Any tool that saves time and effort of educators ultimately propels the education quality further. AI tools can support educators by enabling automation of admission, learning, tutoring, assessments and feedback sharing. MOOCs can extend the reach of learning materials to all and have been enabled by cloud computing. School leadership must realise the need to be open to embracing new innovations.(The author is Business Head, Unthinkable Solutions LLP. Views expressed are personal)
Updated: Sep 11, 2020 08:37 ISTThe JEE Main 2020 results are just around the corner and most students would be trying to understand how to calculate the Percentile and All India Rank.JEE Main 2020 result would be determined through the process of normalisation. The exam was held on different days and sessions. It is quite possible some candidates may get an easy paper while others might have to answer tougher questions in JEE Main 2020 exam paper. To make sure that no aspirant benefits or is at a disadvantage due to this, the process of normalisation would be adopted to determine JEE Main results and ranks. NTA would rank students based on the percentile score obtained in the exam. This percentile score would be calculated as per a pre-determined formula.JEE Main 2020 Result to be declared today: Live UpdatesWhat is Percentile Score?The percentile score would be based on the relative performance of all the aspirants appearing in the exam. The score would be obtained after transforming the scores into a scale ranging from 100 to 0 for each session of examinees.As per the official NTA website, “The Percentile Score indicates the percentage of candidates that have scored EQUAL TO OR BELOW (same or lower raw scores) that particular Percentile in that examination. Therefore, the topper (highest score) of each session gets the same Percentile of 100 which is desirable. The marks obtained in between the highest and lowest scores are also converted to appropriate Percentiles.”Difference between Percentage and PercentilePercentile and the percentage of marks are two totally different entities. Thus, aspirants should not confuse both the above terms. Here’s the difference:Percentage: Percentage is a number out of 100Percentile : Percentile score of a candidate would reflect how many candidates have scored below that candidate in an exam. A Percentile score is the value below which a certain percent of observations fall.Declaration of the final JEE Main 2020 result and All India RanksNTA conducted JEE Main 2020 in two attempts - January and September. Since the exam was held in multiple shifts each day across the two sessions, the calculation of score to a single percentile score is done through a normalization process.What is Normalization?Normalisation is the process of identifying a candidate’s actual merit/rank by creating the same level playing field for every student. The very process is used in other exams across the country to resolve similar issues.The formula to calculate JEE Main 2020 scores is:NTA, to avoid bunching effect and reduce tie-breaking, calculates the percentile scores up to 7 decimal places.Steps Involved in normalisation and preparation of JEE Main 2020 merit/rank list:Step-1: Distribution of examinees in two days and in two shifts per dayCandidates would be distributed into four sessions randomly so that each session has an approximately equal number of candidates. These four sessions are as follows:•Session-1: Day-1 Shift-1•Session-2: Day-1 Shift-2•Session-3: Day-2 Shift-1•Session-4: Day-2 Shift-2Step 2: Preparation of results for each SessionJEE Main 2020 results for each session would be prepared in the form of:•Raw Scores•Percentiles Scores separately for each of the three subjects (Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry) and the total score.•The following four percentiles would be calculated for each candidate in a session:Step 3: Compilation of NTA score and preparation of overall merit/rank listThe percentile scores for the total Raw Score of all the four sessions as calculated in the above step would be merged and known as NTA scores. This would then be used for the compilation of result and preparation of overall JEE Main 2020 Merit List / Ranking.Please note that the percentile of all four sessions would be calculated separately to determine the total Raw Score and Raw Scores in three subjects: Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry.Compilation and display of JEE Result 2020 for multi-sessionCompilation of JEE Main 2020 Result for the first attempt:The first attempt of JEE Main 2020 was held in multi-session, thus, NTA scores would be calculated corresponding to the raw marks secured by a student in each session according to the process above. The NTA scores calculated for all the sessions would be merged to declare JEE Main 2020 result. The result would comprise all the four NTA scores for each of the three subjects: Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry along with the total of the first attempt.Compilation of JEE Main 2020 result for the second attempt:The same above given method would be followed to compile JEE Main results 2020 for the second attempt.Compilation of Result and Preparation of Merit List / RankingThe four NTA scores of each candidate’s first and second attempts would be merged for the compilation of JEE Main result and preparation of overall Merit List/Ranking. Candidates who appeared in both the attempts, their best of the two NTA scores would be considered for the preparation of Merit List /Rankings. The method is explained in the following example:JEE Main Result 2020: Tie-Breaking ResolutionIn case two or more candidates secure equal percentile scores in JEE Main 2020 result, then the ranking would be determined in the following way:Tiebreaker for Paper 1(BTech):•NTA score in Mathematics: Candidate who secures more percentile score in Mathematics would be ranked higher•NTA score in Physics: Candidate who secures more percentile score in Physics would be ranked higher•NTA score in Chemistry: Candidate who secures more percentile score in Chemistry would be ranked higher•Date of Birth: The older candidate would be ranked higherNote: In case the tie still stands unresolved, the same rank is given to the candidatesJEE Main 2020 Tiebreaker for Paper 2 (BArch):•NTA score in Mathematics: Candidate who obtains higher marks in the mathematics would be given a higher rank•NTA score in Aptitude Test: Next, if the tie still persists, then aspirant with a higher score in the aptitude test would be allotted a higher rank•NTA score in Drawing Test: If the tie still persists, then aspirants with higher scores in the drawing test would be allotted a higher rank•Lesser negative response: Candidates having lesser number of negative responses in the paper.•Date of Birth: The older candidate would be ranked higherJEE Main 2020 Tiebreaker for Paper 3 (B. Planning):•NTA score in Mathematics: Aspirants who obtain higher marks in the mathematics would be given a higher rank•NTA score in Aptitude Test: If the tie persists, then aspirant with higher scores in the aptitude test would be given a higher rank•NTA score in Planning Based Questions: If the above criteria do not break the tie, then the candidate would higher marks in planning-based questions would be given the higher rank•Lesser negative response: Candidates having lesser number of negative responses in the paper.•Date of Birth: The older candidate would be ranked higherWhat After JEE Main 2020 Result?•Cutoff for JEE AdvancedNTA would announce the cut-off score for JEE Advanced. In 2019, the cut-off score for general category students was 89.75 while that of OBC – NCL students was 74.Counselling/Selection ProcedureAfter JEE Main and JEE Advanced results would be declared, JoSAA conducts joint seat allocation process for admissions to 100 institutes including 23 IITs, 31 NITs, 25 IIITs and 28 Other GFTIs. Admission to all these JEE Main and JEE Advanced participating institutes would be done through a single counselling platform.(Author of this article is an expert at FITJEE.

UP Board has started preparations for holding the much-awaited high school and intermediate improvement/ compartment examinations. Although the date schedule of the exams has not yet been announced, the board has sought proposals from all districts for making exam centers, said the board officials.The board had accepted online applications for these exams between August 5 and 20. A total of 33,344 students, including 15,839 for improvement/ compartment exams of high school and another 17,505 for intermediate compartment exams, had applied.UP Board secretary Divyakant Shukla has directed all district inspectors of schools (DIOSs) to ensure that there was no problem in complying with social distancing norms and other guidelines laid down by the state government owing to Covid-19 outbreak while conducting the examinations at the centers being proposed by them.In a letter sent to the DIOSs in this regard on September 4, Shukla has instructed the DIOSs that if they foresee any problems in the centres already proposed by them, they could send revised proposals to the board headquarters in this regard by September 6.The missive also made it clear that if the DIOSs were convinced that the exam centres short-listed by them were capable of conducting the improvement/ compartment exams in accordance to the laid down norms while observing social distancing, a certificate to this effect will have to be sent to the secretary, UP Board by Sunday.This is the first time that students of Intermediate have been provided option to appear in compartment exams.UP Board had announced high school and intermediate exam-2020 results on June 27. Around 35,017 Intermediate students had failed in one subject across the state and were eligible to appear in the maiden class 12 compartment exams of the board. In the high school, 3,27,663 had failed in one subject. But they were issued pass certificates as per norms.However, they were eligible to appear in an improvement exam and pass the exam for the subject they had failed. Around 771 high school students had failed in two subjects this time and were eligible to appear in compartment exam in any one of the two subjects that they had failed and bag the pass certificate.
A vaccine is critical to end the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, and India’s pharmaceutical industry and will play a major role because of its ability to manufacture high-quality vaccines at affordable prices, said Bill Gates, Microsoft co-founder and co-chair of The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) in an email interview to HT.The BMGF’s fourth annual Goalkeepers Report released on Tuesday said social and economic impacts of the pandemic have reinforced inequities and derailed 20 years of progress toward the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals that aim to end poverty, fight inequality and injustice, and fix climate change by 2030.Economic damage from Covid-19 is reinforcing inequalities, and extreme poverty has increased by 7%. The International Monetary Fund projections say that despite the US$18 trillion economic stimulus spent around the world, the global economy will lose US$12 trillion or more by the end of 2021, which is the biggest global GDP loss since the end of World War II.Are vaccines against coronavirus disease (Covid-19) likely to provide long-lasting protection?It’s too soon to make predictions about how long protection might last. At this point, we don’t have enough data on the duration of antibody and T-cell response to the disease itself, let alone to the various vaccine candidates. Many of the vaccine trials underway should start to report efficacy data in the next few months, which will start to provide answers to these critical questions. The good news is that there is a large portfolio of vaccines in testing, each with a different approach. This gives the greatest possible chance to develop effective vaccines.Also Read: India likely to play key role in manufacturing of Covid-19 vaccine: Bill GatesWhat role can India’s pharmaceutical and vaccine producers play in stopping Covid-19?They can and will play a major role, because they have the ability to manufacture high-quality vaccines at scale for affordable prices. One great example is the Serum Institute of India, which manufactures more vaccines than any other company in the world. Our foundation and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, recently announced funding to the Serum Institute to help it ramp up manufacturing capacity so it can produce up to 100 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine for low- and middle-income countries in 2021. Serum has agreed to price its vaccines at no more than $3 per dose. Serum is just one company in a very dynamic sector that can support the Covid-19 response. Prior to Covid-19, our foundation has worked extensively with other innovative Indian companies, including Bharat Biotech and BioE, to support them as they develop and deliver safe and effective vaccines for India and for the world.Can Covid-19 end without a vaccine? Is herd immunity possible without a vaccine?When people refer to a herd immunity strategy to manage the pandemic, there are two issues they’re not addressing. The first is that letting people get sick until most are immune and the disease no longer spreads easily will lead to many millions of deaths. The second is that herd immunity is always temporary, because children are born without immunity, and eventually there will be enough susceptible people that the disease can start spreading easily again. For both reasons, a vaccine is critical. It will save lives now and protect future generations from re-living this experience.Also Read: Covid-19 has set global health progress back decades: Gates FoundationSeveral rich countries have pre-ordered millions of doses of vaccines. Does that mean poor and marginalised people will get vaccinated last? How are BMGF and partners ensuring equitable access to vaccines?We are working with many partners on several different fronts to prevent that from happening. One of the key partners is Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which has 20 years of experience helping low-income countries immunise their people. Gavi is helping support Serum Institute in the deal I just mentioned, and it’s one of the main partners in an initiative called COVAX, which brings countries together to pool investments in developing, manufacturing, and delivering vaccines equitably around the world. So far, about 80 countries have made commitments to the COVAX Facility, so momentum is building. In the next month, one of our priorities is to help raise the money that’s needed to ensure that vaccines don’t just go to the highest bidder.Have we had partnerships for a health response at this scale ever before? Is this the future?That’s one of the big tests of this historical moment. Will we see new models of collaboration emerge to meet this new kind of crisis—or will countries turn inward and try to fight a global problem with national interventions? The root cause of everything that’s happening is a virus that doesn’t recognise borders. Borders matter less and less to the global economy, too. While policies that stop at borders may help citizens of a given country cope with the symptoms of the crisis, they won’t stop it. Every country will benefit when all countries work together on solutions. Hopefully, this crisis helps the world understand that and act accordingly.What is the role of technology and data in the Covid-19 response?It would be hard to overstate the importance of data. Right now, while we’re waiting for treatments and vaccines and have to rely on non-pharmaceutical interventions like contract-tracing, quarantine, and social distancing to contain the disease, we need to know with precision how it is spreading. The more countries know about who is at risk, the more likely they are to be able to devise strategies to keep case numbers low. When new treatments and vaccines become available, data will be critical in helping the world determine how those new tools are changing the patterns of disease. As we learn more about Covid-19, we will get better at fighting it—but only if we have access to the data we need to put those lessons to use.You have been saying the world is not prepared for the next pandemic since the H1N1 in 2009. Are we better prepared now?We know a lot more now about what it will take to be fully prepared. We’ve seen examples of partners working in new ways that will help keep the next pandemic from doing as much damage as this one. For example, scientific researchers are collaborating to invent more new solutions, faster. Global health organisations are building innovative partnerships to coordinate their responses. But we will need to watch carefully over the next several years to see whether the world follows through to institutionalise all this new knowledge and these new capabilities. That will mean investing enough in a permanent infrastructure of pandemic preparedness and response that we’re never caught flat-footed again.
The first night of the Indian Premier League 2020 saw two former champions taking on each other in Abu Dhabi. Mumbai Indians batted first and scored 162 runs. The match went down to the last over despite Ambati Rayudu and Faf du Plessis steering the ship for Chennai Super Kings. CSK needed 27 runs off 17 balls when Ravindra Jadeja fell to Krunal Pandya. It looked like MS Dhoni or Kedar Jadhav will walk on to the crease to ease CSK’s nerves.But to the surprise of many, Dhoni chose to send young England all-rounder Sam Curran ahead of him. And it proved to be a masterstroke as Curran came in as a pinch-hitter and stamped his authority on the game. He smashed two sixes and a four in his first five deliveries to put CSK in a comfortable position.READ | CSK vs MI: CSK take all setbacks in their stride, ease to victoryHe fell to Jasprit Bumrah in the second last over but his job was done as the equation got down to just 10 runs off 10 balls. Dhoni and du Plessis then steered their side home with four balls to spare as CSK opened their IPL 2020 campaign with a win. But what prompted Dhoni to send Curran ahead of him? The player says he was also surprised by the decision while also talking about the changed atmosphere in IPL 2020.‘Very different. I have been used to the bubble with the England team. But you are used to seeing big crowds in IPL, so it was different. I haven’t met a lot of the guys, came in a day before, and was straight on the bus today. That was a good thing.‘I was very surprised that I went in. He (Dhoni) is a genius and thought something (about sending me before himself). We targeted that over (18th) and sometimes it comes off and sometimes it doesn’t,’ Curran said at the post-match presentation ceremony.Curran also performed well with the ball as he took one wicket and gave just 28 runs in his quota of 4 overs. CSK will now play Rajasthan Royals on September 22.
The government’s new literacy scheme, ‘Padhna Likhna Abhiyan’, will be a leap forward for achieving the goal of total literacy by 2030, Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ said on Tuesday.“The principal target of the programme is to impart functional literacy and numeracy to 57 lakh non-literate and non-numerate adults in both rural and urban areas across the country in the age group of 15 years and above,” Nishank said at a 54th International Literacy Day event.“This target mostly comprises women, scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, minorities and other disadvantaged groups. In the scheme, among others, priority will be given to districts with female literacy rates less than 60 per cent as per latest census,” he added.Padhna Likhna Abhiyan will be a leap forward for achieving the goal of total literacy by 2030, he said.The minister called upon all stakeholders, including state governments, civil society organisations, corporate bodies, intelligentsia and fellow citizens, to join hands in transforming India to a fully literate society making the country “Saakshar Bharat-Aatmanirbhar Bharat” (literate India, self-reliant India).“Illiteracy is a sin and shame and must be eradicated. Literacy can play an important role of empowering, transforming and improving quality of life of individuals as well as society, especially women and those belonging to disadvantaged groups of society. There is an urgent need to focus attention ensuring that everyone is brought into the fold of literacy and formal education to catch up so that we can move faster towards the national goal,” Minister of State for Education Sanjay Dhotre said.“Literacy need not be viewed as an end in itself. This is particularly relevant to our country as large part of our population is under 35 years of age. This young population, entering into world of work without adequate levels of education and vocational skills will prevent us from taking full advantage of demographic dividend. We have to think how the youth can be brought into the ambit of education and lifelong learning,” he added.In a bid to give a boost to adult education and eradicate illiteracy from the country, the Ministry of Education has launched Padhna Likhna Abhiyan. Under the campaign, students will be engaged and encouraged to teach illiterate elderly people of their respective areas.
Joe Biden has reworked his climate crisis plan, under pressure from younger activists and workers in the United States, to make it ambitious and more result-oriented. He acknowledges that the economy and environment are interconnected.According to the Washington Post, Biden’s new plan calls “for the elimination of carbon pollution from the electric sector by 2035, for the US to rejoin the international Paris climate accord and spend $2 trillion over four years to boost renewables and create incentives for more energy-efficient cars, homes and commercial buildings”.But, for India — and other developing countries — the question is about what America will do about its historic emissions. The climate crisis is largely because of the emissions from the wealthy nations over the years. Small Island Nations are extraordinarily vulnerable-some might even disappear. There’s also India-severely impacted, as freak climate events here have shown.Ideally, nations historically guilty of inflicting this on us and others should finance our efforts to adapt to and mitigate climate change — this is germane to the Equal but Differentiated Responsibilities. But Biden’s plans focus on the US. This is not fine for a country that calls itself a global leader. One hopes that Biden will detail this, although it is likely to be unpopular with Americans in the current economic scenario. A Presidential candidate is already a global face. Their plan must reflect how they intend to empower India and other countries to combat the crisis.(The writer is the Founder and Director of the Chintan Environmental Research and Action Group)

Amid the Covid pandemic which had hit classroom studies, the state government has ordered district magistrates and basic education department officials to explore options of community participation in dealing with the lack of requisite digital infrastructure at most of the 1.60 lakh government-run primary and upper primary schools in Uttar Pradesh.The officials have been asked to contact NGOs, social organisations and even individuals and corporate houses interested in adopting particular schools and help putting in place computers and Wi-Fi connectivity for the benefit of the students.Even gram panchayat funds can be used for upgradation of the schools as centres of digital learning, inform officials.Additional chief secretary, basic education, Renuka Kumar in an order dated September 2 sent to all district magistrates has duly specified the items and their technical specifications needed to boost the digital infra of these institutions, they add.The copies of the order were also marked to all divisional commissioners, director general (school education) and director (basic education) among others.“Acting on the orders, we have asked all block education officers to approach and invite individuals, NGOs and firms among others who could contribute to this noble mission,” said basic shiksha adhikari, Prayagraj, Sanjay Kumar Kushwaha.The plan is to rope in community members and even firms which wish to contribute by way of their corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives in this regard.The missive lists computers, mouse, keyboard, USB ports to Wi-Fi and speakers as well as projectors and screens to inverters that the officials need to strive to procure through this effort for the schools.
Updated: Sep 09, 2020 15:06 ISTThe Supreme Court on Wednesday put interim stay on reservation for Maratha community in government jobs and educational institutions for undergraduate courses in Maharashtra.A three-judge bench headed by Justice L Nageswara Rao stayed the Maharashtra State reservation for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes Act (SEBC Act) while referring the case to a larger bench to consider larger question of whether reservations in public service and educational institutions can exceed the 50 percent cap laid down by the Supreme Court in its 1992 judgment of Indra Sawhney v. Union of India.The SEBC Act originally provided 16 percent reservation for Maratha community in educational institutions and government jobs.The law was challenged before Bombay high court which in June 2019 upheld it’s validity but reduced the quota to 12 percent in educational institutions and 13 percent in jobs.Appeals were filed before Supreme Court stating that the reservation would lead to breach of the 50 percent cap prescribed by Indra Sawhney.Maharashtra government had on August 26 asked the court to place the matter before a larger bench considering the fact that it involves determination of substantial legal questions.
Of the 8.58 lakh candidates who had registered for the JEE (Main) exam for entering engineering colleges, as many as 6.35 lakh braved the threat of COVID-19 and the difficulties imposed by restrictions due to the pandemic, Union Education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank said on Wednesday.“Out of 8.58 lakh #JEEMains applicants, 6.35 lakhs appeared for the exam. Central & respective State Governments assured all possible assistance to the students, for which I compliment all State Governments as well. This entire effort displayed the spirit of cooperative federalism,” Nishank said in a tweet.There were a lot of question over the Center’s decision to hold the entrance test from September 1 to 6 in view of the rising number of COVID-19 cases. Nishank, however, said that a lot of candidates may not have taken the exam in September as they had already done so in the first attempt in January.“Exams are held twice in a year. The previous one was held in January this year. Several students who didn’t appear for the exam in Sept may have done well in the January exam hence did not feel the need to sit for the exam this time. We are ascertaining those numbers,” he said.In another tweet, the Education minister said that further delaying the exam would not have been in the interest of the students.“Any further delay of the exams would not have been in the interest of our hardworking students & their plans for college admissions. Our NDA Government has always been unwavering regarding student welfare & student safety. We will always work for the interests of our youth,” he said.Referring to a tweet by BJP MP Subramanian Swamy, Nishank said that “the number of applicants for #JEEMains stands at 8.58 lakhs, not 18 lakhs as you tweeted”. After JEE (Main), the NTA is preparing for the NEET medical entrance exam.
Despite repeated warnings by the Delhi government, several private schools in the city have been allegedly denying students access to online education for not paying fees amid the Covid-19 lockdown, parents said.Some schools have already struck off the names of students from online classes while others are issuing notices, warning that the children would be barred if they don’t pay fees, many parents have complained.The directorate of education (DoE) had on August 30 directed all private schools in Delhi not to refuse access to online classes to students whose parents were unable to pay fees during the lockdown due to financial problems.“Heads of the schools shall, in no case, deny ID & password to those students/parents for getting online access of educational facilities/classes/materials, etc., to those students who are unable to pay the school fee due to financial crisis arising out of closure of business activities in the ongoing lockdown condition,” the order stated. This order was in continuation of another similar one issued on April 18.A senior official at Delhi government’s education department said, “The order clearly says that in no case, schools would deny access to online education to students if they cannot pay fees, including the tuition fee, due to financial crises triggered by the lockdown. The parents can complain to the department if the schools are doing so.”Despite the orders, parents of several students of Delhi Public School (DPS), Mathura Road, alleged the school had removed the names of some students from online classes over fees on Monday.The father of a class 3 student said he could not submit the fees this academic session as he is out of work since March. “I have been informing the school that I am struggling to make my ends meet after losing work due to the lockdown. I had promised them that I will submit all dues by October but they removed the name of my child from Microsoft teams (online video conferencing app). I have no idea what to do now?” said the parent, who runs a garment shop in Chandni Chowk.The mother of two students at the same school said they also could not pay the fee this academic session, due to which the school had removed the names of her children from online classes. “My husband is in the printing business and work has been completely shut since March due to the lockdown. There is hardly any earning these days. One of our family members has died due to Covid-19 and we are under huge hospital debt. We have written emails to the schools informing all this, but still the names of my kids have been removed from online classes.”.School principal Deeksha Khera declined to comment on the matter. A senior official at the school, requesting anonymity, said, “Online classes have been discontinued for only those students who did not pay anything in this academic session. Parents should at least submit fees for a month or two. There should be some accountability.”Some schools have directed parents to pay the fees at the earliest, failing which the names of their wards would be removed from online classes.For instance, ASN Senior Secondary School in Mayur Vihar issued a notice on Monday, asking parents to pay their dues by September 14. “Please note that after September 14, the school will not be able to continue the online classes of students who have not deposited the tuition fee for even up till the month of July,” the notice read. The school has, however, asked parents having financial hardship to produce “documentary support”.The father of a class 4 student at the school, who runs a readymade garments shop in Karol Bagh, said he and some other parents have already written to the school, informing them that they won’t be able to pay the fees immediately due to financial hardship.”The school is asking us to produce a document. How do I prove that I am not getting customers these days and my earnings are hand to mouth?” he said.School principal Swarnima Luthra said the school was not being able to pay salaries to the staff because parents are not paying fees. “Those who are having difficulty in paying can give us some proof such as bank statements or something like that,” she said.The DoE had also asked schools to refund or adjust money in case they had collected any other payment from parents in this academic session. However, parents said the schools are not following the order.The father of a class 3 student at Brain International School in west Delhi’s Vikaspuri said he was working in an event organising company and is out of work since March, “I had enrolled my child in the school this year and paid annual changes and three months fees. But at that time I was working. I have requested the school to adjust the annual fee I had paid earlier but they are not listening.”Despite several attempts, school principal Seema Behl did not respond to calls and texts sent for a comment.Aprajita Gautam, president of the Delhi parents association, said that they are collecting complaints against private schools from parents and will send them all to the office of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.“Despite the government’s orders we have been receiving multiple complaints against private schools for harassing parents for fees amid a pandemic. We will soon collect and send all these complaints to the CM office, requesting action against these schools,” she said.
Actor Kangana Ranaut has said that she has charted her own path in the film industry, and was served nothing on a platter. Kangana’s remarks come a day after Samajwadi Party MP Jaya Bachchan questioned Kangana’s comments about the film industry being a ‘gutter’.Kangana in a tweet wrote in Hindi, “What thali (plate) is Jaya referring to? The one that was offered was to appear in a two-minute role, a romantic scene, item numbers -- and that too after sleeping with the hero? I taught the industry feminism, decorated the thali with patriotic films, this is my own plate Jaya ji, not yours.”कौन सी थाली दी है जया जी और उनकी इंडस्ट्री ने? एक थाली मिली थी जिसमें दो मिनट के रोल आइटम नम्बर्ज़ और एक रोमांटिक सीन मिलता था वो भी हेरो के साथ सोने के बाद,मैंने इस इंडस्ट्री को फ़ेमिनिज़म सीखाया,थाली देश भक्ति नारीप्रधान फ़िल्मों से सजाई,यह मेरी अपनी थाली है जया जी आपकी नहीं। https://t.co/lPo9X4hRZX — Kangana Ranaut (@KanganaTeam) September 16, 2020Jaya had said on the second day of the Monsoon Session in Parliament, “People in the entertainment industry are being flogged by social media. People who made their names in the industry have called it a gutter. I completely disagree. I hope that the government tells such people not to use this kind of language. Jis thali mein khate hai usme chhed karte hai. Galat baat hai (they bite the hand that feeds, it’s wrong).” Previously, Kangana had called the film industry a ‘gutter’ and alleged that 99% of the people who work in it have been exposed to drugs.Jaya’s comments came after Kangana’s sustained attacks on a few powerful members of the film industry, whom she refers to as the ‘movie mafia’. Kangana has alleged that the ‘movie mafia’ mistreats outsiders such as herself and the late Sushant Singh Rajput, whose death fuelled this debate.After Sushant’s girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty was arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau on drugs-related charges, the spotlight fell on the film industry, and the alleged drug consumption that takes place there.Many members of the industry, such as Sonam Kapoor, Richa Chaddha and Farhan Akhtar hailed Jaya’s comments, and appreciated her taking a stand for the rest of them. “I send my best regards to Jaya Ji. Those who don’t know, please see this is how the spinal cord looks,” filmmaker Anubhav Sinha wrote on Twitter.
Odisha plans to launch its social protection delivery platform or social registry by the beginning of next fiscal enabling the government to monitor the well-being of beneficiaries of several state and central welfare schemes while weeding out ineligible claimants.Officials said work on the creation of a social registry had begun with the beneficiaries listed in the database of Krushak assistance for livelihood and income augmentation (Kalia) being taken as the base for the proposed database.The Kalia scheme, one of the several state schemes and started in Janauary 2019, helps more than 51 lakh small, marginal and landless farmers receive Rs 5000 each twice a year as farm assistance for purchase of inputs like seeds, fertilisers, pesticides, labour charges per agriculture season.State finance secretary AKK Meena, nodal officer for the social registry, said through processes like Aadhaar authentication and bank account verification, the beneficiary database of each of the departments can be cleaned up for weeding out ineligible people.“As different departments have created databases for different schemes without authentication and data sanitisation, the social registry would ensure that each of the eligible beneficiaries is properly identified. It would weed out ineligible beneficiaries from various schemes. The social registry would be a super database in which databases of all departments would be integrated. We expect the social registry to be ready by the end of March next year,” said Meena.Odisha runs around 60 social assistance programmes that account for a large share of its annual GDP. Programmes like Kalia, Madhubabu pension yojana, Mamata scheme, Biju pucca ghar yojana, Biju krushak kalyan yojana, Mukhyamantri swasthya seva mission, Barishtha nagarika tirtha yatra yojana and Kalinga shiksha sathi yojana, cover almost 70 per cent of the total 4.2 crore people of the State.Though the social welfare schemes have ensured BJD’s victory in successive elections since 2000, the schemes have also bled the state treasury as there have been allegations of ineligible and dead beneficiaries crowding the list. A month ago, Odisha had made Aadhaar verification of beneficiaries of National social assistance programme and Madhu babu pension yojana as mandatory to get the monthly pension. Though it temporarily backed down from its decision at the last moment following protests from activists, the SSEPD department wants to follow through the process. Similarly, at least 50,000 people from the 51 lakh beneficiaries of Kalia scheme too, were found to be ineligible and asked to return the assistance money.Also Read: Rs 10 lakh hike in ex-gratia for Odisha cops and staff killed by MaoistsOfficials said the existing databases of national food security act, Kalia, birth & death, MGNREGA, mission shakti, old age pension, disability pension, scholarship, skill development would be sanitised through local government directory mapping.Officials involved with the process said the agriculture and farmers’ empowerment department which is preparing a farmers’ database for social registry has devised an anomaly detection algorithm to detect any fraud or data anomaly such as during buying seeds for paddy, selling oilseeds.Also Read: Opposition parties snub Congress in joint protest over GSTA detailed SOP with a 3-tier verification has been created that would ensure collection of farmers’ number, their gender, marital status, mobile number, residential address and bank account details for Aadhaar authentication, LGD mapping, bank account verification and Aadhaar lookup with national payment corporation of India. While creating the social registry the government is taking due care of data privacy, officials added.
The ministry of corporate affairs (MCA) is close to releasing a draft report which will pave way for Indian companies to list their shares in overseas markets without listing in India first, two regulatory officials aware of the matter said.The ministry will propose changes to Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), Income Tax Act and Companies Act, the officials said on condition of anonymity. These will include amendments on taxing share transfers in India and adding enabling provisions under the Companies Act 2013 to allow listing of certain classes of securities on stock exchanges in permissible foreign jurisdictions. The proposal was cleared by the Union cabinet in March.“FEMA would be amended to include a category of ‘permissible investors’ from select jurisdictions. These companies will also be governed by the rules of the jurisdiction in which they are listed,” said the first of the two persons, both of whom spoke on condition of anonymity.Currently, a company incorporated in India can list on a foreign stock exchange only after it is listed in India. MakeMyTrip, which is listed on Nasdaq, had to incorporate itself in Mauritius to facilitate overseas listing without going public in India.After the Union cabinet green-lighted the proposal in March, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman reiterated the policy intent in May, on the last of a five-day-long series of announcements on the Rs20 trillion financial package to ease covid-19 related hardships.“Overseas listing of shares will likely provide Indian companies with an alternate route to access capital and will also bring exposure to a broader and likely more global investor base. Such listing will facilitate comparisons with global listed peers and may lead to accurate benchmarking and higher valuations. Some of the successful start-ups in the technology and internet sector, including companies commonly referred as ‘unicorns’, which may still not be profitable, maybe able to access larger pools of capital from overseas markets in developed economies,” said Yash Ashar, partner and head of capital markets, Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas.The idea for overseas listing was first floated by a committee set up by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi). In its recommendations in December 2018, it said listing Indian companies abroad would require simultaneous easing of provisions of taxation and foreign exchange management act (FEMA) among others.FEMA, at present, does not contemplate a company incorporated in India and listed on a foreign stock exchange selling shares to a person resident outside India. Companies Act 2013 currently has rules for public offers and private placements of securities, is applicable to all companies incorporated in India, including companies that issue ADRs/GDRs as well as those which would propose to list their equity shares on foreign stock exchanges.The ministry is also in favour of allowing listing in certain key permissible jurisdictions. “These jurisdictions will have strong anti-money laundering norms, know your client norms and would need to be compliant with foreign action task force (FATF),” the first/second person?? added.A Sebi discussion paper had suggested 10 permissible jurisdictions which have strong anti-money laundering laws such as US, UK, China, Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Switzerland, France, Germany, Canada.
Low wind speed in and around Delhi has started impacting the city’s air, with the air quality index (AQI) reading 133 at 7am on Sunday.After a month of the cleanest air in five years, Delhi’s air quality has started worsening. With monsoon almost drawing to a close and little possibility of more rainfall this month, Delhi’s air quality may deteriorate further by the end of September, scientists at India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.Also Read: Heavy rain in peninsular region to persist, says IMDOn Saturday, the AQI reading as recorded by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) was 118 at 4pm.An AQI reading of 0-50 is considered ‘good’ (minimal health risk), 51-100 is ‘satisfactory’ (minor discomfort to sensitive people), and 100-200 is ‘moderate’ (breathing discomfort to people with lungs and heart disease).“Clean air days may almost be over now, as meteorological conditions change. The monsoon is set to withdraw by September-end, after which calm winds will blow across the northwestern region, which are not favourable for the dispersion of pollutants. The pollutants suspended in the air, which were till last month being blown away by the rain and winds are likely to hang in over the city in the absence of any such weather activity,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of regional weather forecasting centre, IMD.
Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal on Sunday virtually inaugurated three recently-completed projects at the Central University of Jammu here.In his address to the attendees of the inauguration, Pokhriyal appreciated the leadership of the university for naming the projects after Dr Syama Prasad Mookerjee, Pandit Premnath Dogra and Brigadier Rajendra Singh.He also appreciated the institutional building efforts and initiatives of Vice-Chancellor Professor Ashok Aima for academic visibility of the University at national and international levels.Sanjay Dhotre, Minister of State for Education, and special guest at the meeting said, “Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India has excelled in every sector and our country is achieving new milestones with each passing day. We will leave no stone unturned to further strengthen the education system of the country.”Professor Ashok Aima, Vice-Chancellor, Central University of Jammu also addressed the participants with a brief description of the major achievements of the university during his tenure since April 2015.“The University has been successful in attaining an all India character by admitting students and research scholars across diverse regions of the country, thereby offering testimony to the nationalistic bonding and the academic spectrum of the Central University of Jammu”, he said.
Sushant Singh Rajput’s US-based brother-in-law Vishal Singh Kirti has penned his thoughts three months after the actor’s death, reminiscing about their time together. He said instead of writing on ‘paid PR gimmicks’, he decided to write about their time with Sushant.“Instead of talking about the case, I will reminisce about a couple of things. Since my wife and I don’t live in India, we used to catch up with Sushant over FaceTime or WhatsApp. Here is a cute screenshot of one of our FaceTime conversations,” he wrote. He also thanked their “Extended Family”, the #Warriors4SSR, who have been supporting the family in their ‘pursuit of justice’.Occasionally,I will share some sweet memory of Sushant with the "Extended Family"so that we slowly heal while the fight for justice is on. Needless to say, we are so thankful for the support we have received from the #Warriors4SSR in the pursuit of justice.https://t.co/kzTaG10r4O — vishal kirti (@vikirti) September 14, 2020“What’s happened is so surreal that we are partly still in trauma. Every now and then, we smile and laugh about something our children do and a wave of guilt takes over. We question ourselves if we have the permission to smile when we have lost our brother. It will take us a long while before we go back to normal and I am pretty sure we will never be back to the status quo, but we will keep trying to heal and hopefully time will help,” he wrote about how the family has been dealing with their loss.He also remembered how Sushant was extremely protective of his sister. “As for a sweet anecdote, when Shweta and I started dating in college, Sushant, playing a typical protective brother, questioned my intentions for his sister. We assured him that we were serious about the relationship but he was only fully convinced when I came down from the US to marry Shweta in 2007, after a short stint with long distance relationship. Rest is history!”
Amid protests by farmers in Punjab and Haryana against the central government’s three new farm bills, senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh on Friday ‘warned’ Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala not to support the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on the ‘anti-farmer bills.’Singh also ‘congratulated’ Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal for resigning from the Unioncabinet in protest against the legislations.“I want to congratulate Harsimrat Kaur Badal for resigning from the government in support of farmers and would want Dushyant Chautala not to support the BJP on these anti-farmer bills, otherwise he will suffer big defeat in future. He should support farmers,” the senior Congress leader said.Chautala’s Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) is in alliance with the BJP in Haryana and Punjab’s SAD, meanwhile, is the BJP’s oldest ally. Badal was the sole SAD representative in the central government, holding the food processing industries portfolio.Singh further praised his party for ‘making the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act pro-farmers.’ “Congress government had made APMC Act in favour of farmers. But now, any big trader can open a mandi and under these new anti-farmer bills, any dispute at mandi will be handled by officials. All these four anti-farmer ordinances should be seen in totality,” he further said.Farmers are against these bills as, according to them, these would lead to complete dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system. Opposition parties, including the Congress, have vociferously protested against these legislations in Parliament. However, PM Modi has assured farmers MSP would not be withdrawn.The three contentious bills are: The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020, Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, and Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020.While the Lok Sabha passed the latter two on Thursday, the former was passed by it on Tuesday.
Be cautious against those trying to mislead you by creating doubts, said Prime Minister Narendra Modi to farmers on Friday, a day after BJP’s oldest ally Shiromani Akali Dal pulled out its only minister from the union cabinet over the farm bills. The PM, without naming anyone, said some are “bent upon spreading lies”.The farmers’ produce trade and commerce (promotion and facilitation) bill, 2020 and the farmers (empowerment and protection) agreement on price assurance and farm services bill 2020, were passed by the Lok Sabha on Thursday that led to opposition by the Congress and resignation of Union minister Harsimar Kaur Badal of the Akali Dal.“Those who did nothing for decades when they were in power are today opposing the bills for agriculture reforms aimed at deregulating the farm sector to give farmers better options and opportunities. The bills are aimed at unshackling the farmers and protecting them from middlemen. They can now sell their produce anywhere, anytime on their own terms,” the PM said.Modi was speaking at the launch of 12 railways projects, including the long-awaited Kosi Rail Mahasetu connecting Kosi and Mithila regions, in Bihar through video conferencing.Aware of the opposition to the farm bills, especially by the Congress and also from SAD, Modi congratulated the farmers for the bills that he said would usher in greater freedom and returns for their produce and work as a ‘protective cover’ for them.“Some people are bent upon spreading lies and siding with middlemen despite having done nothing for farmers for decades when they had the opportunity. They also talked about it, mentioned it in their manifestoes before elections and conveniently forgot about it later, but when the NDA government has done it, they have problems. They have developed a tendency of opposing for the sake of opposing,” he added.Modi said the farmers of the country need to be cautious against those trying to mislead them by creating doubts. “They are spreading rumours that the government will not procure foodgrains at the minimum support price (MSP). Let me tell you, it is wrong. The government is committed to ensuring MSP to farmers. The government procurement will also continue as it is today,” he added.Referring to CM Nitish Kumar, Modi said Bihar understood the problems of farmers due to agriculture produce market committee (APMC) Act quite early and now the Centre was following the Bihar model. Bihar had dissolved all agriculture marketing committees and marketing boards in the state in 2006 after repealing the state government’s then APMC Act.Modi said that the NDA government had done so much for the farmers in the last six years that was never done earlier. “We have looked into each problem the farmers have to face. To prevent farmers from falling into loan trap, the PM Kisan Kalyan Yojana was launched and so far over 10-crore farmers have benefited from it, wherein over Rs 1-lakh crore has been directly deposited into their bank accounts without any middleman,” he added.Modi said that aware of the irrigation problems, Rs 1-lakh crore is also being spent on the Kisan Sinchai Yojana. “The first Kisan rain also ran from Bihar to Maharashtra. A lot has been done and a lot more will be done for the welfare of the farmers. They need to guard against those who don’t want betterment of farmers. We want to unshackle farmers so that they could have multiple options and opportunities to increase their income,” he added.
Coronavirus positive senior BJD MLA Debi Prasad Mishra was raided by the Central Bureau of Investigation on Friday over his alleged involvement in Rs 578 crore Seashore chit fund scam.A five-member team of the CBI, along with two witnesses, took part in the raid that is being conducted at seven places. The probe agency, in August 2016, has already interrogated Mishra’s two associates -Prafulla Singha, a BJD leader, and Dilip Mishra.Seashore is one of the 44 companies that is being investigated by the CBI since May 2014, following a Supreme Court order. The company reportedly raised around Rs 578 crore from gullible people offering 36 per cent interest per annum to the investors against their deposits.Mishra, former school and mass education minister under home isolation after testing positive for Covid-19, said the CBI officials asked him about the boating project of Seashore on Mahanadi river which was allowed during his tenure as tourism minister.“I had allowed Seashore to set up a boating project in Mahanadi along with a restaurant on the outskirts of Cuttack city. Besides, I had also given permission to the company to manage a government-run guest house at Atri in Khurda district. All this was allowed as per the government’s decision. I have already appeared before the CBI and been interrogated in this matter,” he said, adding that CBI officials have taken all files from the department.In September 2017, the CBI had arrested the then BJD MLA Prabhat Biswal in connection with the Seashore ponzi scam. He was later released on bail in June 2018.The CBI has filed two charge-sheets before a Bhubaneswar-based CBI court - March 2015 and January 2018 - accusing Seashore chief Prashant Dash and his brother Prabhat of embezzling about Rs 578.2 crore, collected from investors between 2006 and 2011. The case is now being tried. The ED is also separately probing the Seashore group’s financial transactions.The Seashore scam has remained a major source of embarrassment for the Naveen Patnaik government after the CBI found that several senior IAS, IPS and BJD leaders were involved in it. Operating through one Subhankar Nayak, the company allegedly paid illegal gratification to some IAS, IPS officers of Odisha and BJD leaders for expanding its business. Nayak was earlier arrested and sent to jail in November 2014.The company also gained access to Saroj Sahoo, a one-time DTP operator who worked in Naveen Niwas and allegedly played an important role in the regional party. In September 2017, the CBI arrested erstwhile BJD MLA Prabhat Biswal in connection with the scam.Seashore was started in 2006 by Prashant Dash, an economics professor in a private college in Angul district, with the company raising capital from public without listing itself in stock exchange, mandatory if the number of shareholders cross 50.It also registered some of its firms under the Odisha Self Help Cooperative Societies Act that allowed it to remain out of the government’s checks and balances.To attract customers, the company offered 36 per cent interest per annum to the investors against their deposits, which was nearly four times the rates offered by nationalised banks.The Central Economic Intelligence Bureau in February and March 2011 had alerted the Odisha government on how the company was collecting a huge amount of money from investors assuring them of high returns. The commission being paid to agents ranged from 15 to 20 per cent. Using his proximity to former BJD strongman Pyari Mohan Mohapatra, Dash entered into a clutch of partnerships with state government in healthcare, tourism, dairy, pharma, food processing and cooperative sector, it said.Most of these partnerships did not help the government as Seashore never had the requisite expertise and know-how to run the new business. In 2012, it signed an MoU with Grid Corporation of Odisha, a bulk power supplier for purchase of solar power from the firm.However, the agreement fell through after Seashore had failed to pay the bank guarantee of Rs 24 crore within the stipulated time. Like Saradha which ran a TV channel in Bengal, Seashore too started a TV channel, STV, in Odisha.It reportedly recruited the wife of a senior IPS officer for an astrological show at a huge cost to the company. Bollywood actress Katrina Kaif graced the inauguration of the TV channel in May 2011.
Indian-origin Senator Kamala Harris said she thought of her mother “immediately” when former vice president Joe Biden offered her to be his running mate on the Democratic ticket for the November presidential elections.Trailblazer Harris, 55, has scripted history in the American political system by becoming the first black, first African-American and Indian-American to be a vice presidential candidate for a major political party. Her mother Shyamala Gopalan Harris migrated to the US as a 19-year-old young graduate from India in 1957 for higher studies.In multiple interviews, Harris has reflected on the profound impact her mother, a renowned cancer specialist, had on where she is now. “I thought immediately of my mother and what she must be thinking as she looks down on us,” Harris said in response to a question during a fund raiser.“What was it like to get that Zoom call from Joe Biden (last month),” she was asked.Harris recounted how she and her team got a call that Biden wanted to talk and then got another call where she was told Biden wanted to do a zoom call. She described how she went in “our little makeshift office” and then when the call started Biden immediately asked her to join the ticket.After referring to her mother, Harris also described how husband Doug Emhoff’s ear was on the door outside the room listening in on the call. Eventually Jill Biden and Emhoff joined the call with Biden and Harris.When asked how she will present her and Biden’s vision for the first 100 days, Harris said the first thing is to “get the virus under control.” “Specifically, we will create a pandemic board that will oversee testing. So that’s about distribution, it’s about testing is happening in an efficient manner. It’s also about making sure we are investing in the tests that are most relevant in the tests that we are trying to accomplish, so for example rapid testing,” she said.Harris went on to tick off economic relief through a series of executive orders “to strengthen buy American rules so that tax payer dollars support American products and supply chains.” “Again, day one, re-enter the Paris Climate agreements,” Harris said. She pointed to California, Oregon and Washington and said “all of this is predictable.” She continued “Reengage our NATO allies. And this is again a real strength of Joe’s. He has the experience based on a long history of being in the Senate and being a leader on foreign affairs and then of course eight years of being vice president.” Harris said that she will send a bill to congress immediately creating a pathway to citizenship for our dreamers and the 11 million undocumented immigrants” Harris said. She said the administration would push a bill to “deal with systemic racism.” “People are marching in the streets. Minnesota of course are experiencing this and there are reforms that are important that can be put in place so we can do things like ban carotid chokeholds, which of course would’ve saved the life of George Floyd,” she said.A Biden-Harris administration would also introduce a national standard for use of force and national police standard oversight commission.
Higher educational institutions as well as skill training centres can resume their classes from September 21, the Union health ministry said on Tuesday, while asking them to implement staggered classroom activities with separate time slots, mandatory six feet distance between desks and carry out disinfection of premises, among other COVID-19 safety measures.The guidelines, issued by the ministry, said that seating arrangement should be done in a way to ensure a distance of six feet between chairs and desks. “Staggering of classroom activities to be done, with separate timing slots, to allow for adequate physical distancing and disinfection of classroom premises. Academic scheduling should have an intermix of regular classroom teaching and online teaching and assessments,” the ministry said. In shared rooms and dormitories, the guidelines said, beds should be placed at a distance of six feet from each other. “Temporary partitions may be considered, if feasible. Any symptomatic student should be immediately given a single room and then provided requisite medical care,” the guidelines said.“Mess facility, if any within the premises, shall follow physical distancing norms at all times. Staggering of meal timings may be done to prevent overcrowding. Hostels should be out of bound for all persons except essential staff with known health status,” the ministry said. The generic preventive measures include simple public health measures that are to be followed to reduce the risk of COVID-19. These measures need to be observed by all faculty, employees, students and visitors at these places at all times, according to the guidelines. These measures include physical distancing of at least six feet, use of face covers or masks, frequent hand washing with soap and use of alcohol-based hand sanitisers, they said.“Institutions conducting skill or entrepreneurship training, higher educational institutions conducting doctoral courses and post-graduate studies shall specifically ensure online and distance learning continue to be permitted and encouraged, skill or entrepreneurship training will be permitted with effect from September 21, and higher educational institutions conducting Ph.D or technical and professional programmes requiring laboratory and experimental works will be permitted by department of higher education in consultation with MHA (Ministry of Home Affairs) strictly following guidelines as indicated in the SOPs,” the ministry said in its guidelines.The guidelines said such institutions will only be allowed to open if they are outside containment zones. Further, students and staff living in containment zones will not be allowed to attend the institution, the ministry said. “Students and staff shall also be advised not to visit areas falling within containment zones,” it said.Prior to resumption of activities, the guidelines said, all work areas intended for conducting skill or entrepreneurship training, doctoral courses and post graduate studies, hostels, laboratories, other common utility areas have to be sanitised with one per cent sodium hypochlorite solution.“Wherever skill based training on equipments are envisaged to be utilised, place the equipment six feet apart, wherever feasible, to facilitate physical distancing. Similarly, utilise any outdoor space by relocating equipment outside like in verandah, courtyard, shed, etc,” the ministry said in the guidelines.The guidelines further said the academic calendar shall be planned with a view to avoid overcrowding and congregation.“As far as possible, the academic calendar should promote a mix of regular classes and online teaching and training, assessments. The day-wise, time-wise scheduling of teaching/training activities may be done in a staggered manner so as to avoid overcrowding at any one location on any day,” it said. “For practical activities in laboratories maximum capacity per session based on redesigned spaces, may be planned and scheduled accordingly,” the ministry added.

Updated: Sep 08, 2020 19:05 ISTThe Central Institute of Petrochemicals Engineering and Technology will soon set up new centres for skilling and technical support at Bhagalpur and Varanasi, Chemicals and Fertilisers Ministry said on Tuesday.Chemicals and Petrochemicals Department Secretary R K Chaturvedi said that around 1,000 youths will be trained in each centre every year through diploma and skill development programmes for gainful employment in petrochemicals and allied industries.The technical support services offered by these centres -- Bhagalpur (Bihar) and Varanasi (Uttar Pradesh) -- will act as a catalyst for the development and growth of new and existing industries in the region, he said.Presently, the CIPET (Central Institute of Petrochemicals Engineering and Technology) has 43 operational centres and nine more centres are in the process of establishment across the country catering to the needs of Polymer and allied industries.CIPET also has 31 Skilling and Technology Support Centres where Diploma, PG Diploma and Skill development training programmes are being organised in the field of polymer science, engineering and technology.CIPET is actively contributing towards the government’s several initiatives such as Skill India, Make in India, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Stand up India, Start-Up India and Digital India.
Goldman Sachs and Fitch Ratings on Tuesday forecast deeper-than-previously estimated economic recession for India in FY21 holding that limited fiscal support, fragilities in the financial system and a continued rise in coronavirus cases are hampering a rapid normalisation in economic activity.Investment bank Goldman Sachs anticipates India’s gross domestic product (GDP) to shrink 14.8% this fiscal against its earlier estimate of an 11.8% contraction. Fitch Ratings, meanwhile, cut its growth forecast for India for FY21 to a contraction of 10.5%, more than double the 5% contraction projected in June.The latest estimates by Fitch and Goldman Sachs are among the worst for the Indian economy for this fiscal, which may make it the deepest contraction so far in India’s history. The previous lowest was a GDP contraction of 5.2% in FY80.India’s economy contracted 23.9% in the June quarter in the steepest pace in four decades. It was the worst performance among G20 nations, and significantly below expectations of most economists, as the stringent covid-19-induced national lockdown created a double-whammy through both a supply and demand side shock as businesses shut operations while consumers were forced to stay home.“In light of the Q2 (June quarter) GDP report, we are making further significant adjustments to our GDP forecasts for India. We now forecast Q3 (September quarter) 2020, and Q4 (December quarter) 2020 at GDP growth of -13.7% yoy and -9.8% yoy, respectively (compared to -10.7% yoy and -6.7% yoy previously). Our estimates imply that real GDP falls by 11.1% in calendar year 2020, and by 14.8% in FY21 (vs growth of -9.6%, and -11.8% in our previous forecasts),” Goldman Sachs said in a research note.However, Goldman Sachs upgraded its expectations of a rebound next year. “In Q2 (June quarter) 2021, we expect real GDP growth to bounce back sharply on a year-over-year basis due to favorable base effects. Assuming ~70% of the lost output in June 2020 is recovered in June 2021, we expect real GDP in Q2 2021 at +27.1% yoy. Going forward, assuming a step down to more normal levels of sequential growth, we now expect average annual GDP growth in CY21 and FY22 at 9.9% and 15.7% respectively (relative to 3.8% and 7.0% before). Our forecasts assume that in level terms, real output in March 2022 would still be ~2% below its level in March 2020,” it added.In its latest Global Economic Outlook for 2020, Fitch revised upwards its global GDP estimate to a contraction of 4.4% from a contraction of 4.6% estimated in June, as it raised its growth estimates for the US (0.6%) and China (2%). Fitch said its global GDP estimate for 2020 is weighed down by deeper contractions expected in India, Eurozone and the UK.The rating agency said India’s GDP should rebound strongly in the September quarter amid a re-opening of the economy, but there are signs that the recovery has been sluggish and uneven. “The PMI balances have bounced back but they imply that the level of activity is still well below its pre-pandemic level in 3Q20 (September quarter). Still-depressed levels of imports, two-wheeler sales and capital goods production indicate a muted recovery in domestic spending,” it added.Fitch said multiple challenges are holding back the recovery in India, both in the short and medium term. “New cases of the coronavirus continue to increase, forcing some states and union territories to re-tighten restrictions, though these localised containment measures are generally less stringent than in March-April. The continued spread of the virus and the imposition of sporadic shutdowns across the country depress sentiment and disrupt economic activity,” it added.The severe fall in activity has also damaged household and corporate incomes and balance sheets, amid limited fiscal support, the rating agency said. “A looming deterioration in asset quality in the financial sector will hold back credit provision amid weak bank capital buffers,” it added.Fitch said the recent spurt in inflation has added strains to household incomes. “Supply-chain disruptions and excise duties increases have caused prices to rise. However, we expect inflation to slow amid weak underlying demand, an easing in supply-chain disruptions and a good monsoon,” it added.India poised to see worst ever contraction in GDP this fiscal year
Updated: Sep 18, 2020 14:10 ISTThe bills to reduce salaries, allowances of Members of Parliament, and Ministers by 30 percent was passed unanimously in the Rajya Sabha on Friday.Earlier, Union Ministers G Kishan Reddy and Pralhad Joshi had moved the Salaries and Allowances of Ministers (Amendment) Bill, 2020 and the Salary, Allowances and Pension of Members of Parliament (Amendment) Bill, 2020 in the Rajya Sabha.Speaking in the Rajya Sabha, the Minister of State (MoS) Home Affairs said that he was moving the Bill on behalf of Union Home Minister Amit Shah.While MPs from Congress, Biju Janata Dal (BJD), and other parties wholeheartedly supported the bill, they asked the Centre to restore the MPLADS Funds at the earliest.The MPs said that the MPLADS Funds are used by them to help the public in their constituencies and will be of great use during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.Earlier, AIADMK MP A Vijayakumar and BJD MP Prasanna Acharya had also demanded that the government release their arrears of the MPLADS funds for previous years.The Monsoon session of the Parliament which began on Monday is slated to conclude on October 1.
Almost two weeks after the Supreme Court clarified that final year students can only be promoted based on examination, the University of Mumbai released an official circular detailing the examination dates and format.Addressed to all affiliated colleges, the varsity has clarified that all exams will be conducted online in multiple choice question (MCQ) format and only in special cases where students have not been able to appear for exams online will be allowed to appear for offline exams.In a circular released on Wednesday morning, MU has stated that practical and theory exams for repeater candidates will begin from September 15 and 25, respectively, whereas fresh candidates will appear for exams from October 1 to 17. Colleges have been asked to share a sample paper and question bank with students, and conduct a mock-test online in the new format for all their students before the final exams begin.“As discussed earlier, online exams will be in MCQ format and students will have one hour to appear for 50 marks in each subject. These 50 marks will then be converted into the 75/80/100 marks as prescribed by each subject. Only handicap students will be allowed an extra 20 minutes for the same paper and will also have the option of choosing a writer for the examination,” said a spokesperson for University of Mumbai.He added that colleges have also been asked to ensure early assessment of all papers to avoid any further delay in announcement of results. “Exams in the MCQ format will not be eligible for re-evaluation, so results should not take very long,” he added.For starters, all MU affiliated colleges will have to conduct an online survey of their own students to find out where they are residing at present (due to the lockdown), and what gadgets (mobile phone, laptop/desktop) and internet facilities are available for each student in order to find out how many can conveniently appear for online exams.“Colleges have also been asked to start a helpline number to counsel students and listen to grievances if any,” added the spokesperson.While the MU has clarified its stand on examinations and has left colleges to take forward the process, many head of institutes are not happy about the convenience with which all onus of exams have been pushed on individual colleges.“In less than a week we will have to start practical exams for repeater candidates and by October 1 final exams for fresh candidates. In between all this, each teacher needs to submit 250 MCQ format questions for each subject, set final and mock-test question papers, conduct online survey for students, as well as ensure that a helpline number is up and running for student queries. The amount of work expected from teachers is unacceptable, that too at a time when they are already busy with online classes for the current batches,” said the principal of a suburban college on condition of anonymity.Colleges will have the option of setting up their own time table as long as they follow the dates as prescribed by the university. Once all subject marks are submitted by individual colleges to the university, the final results will be announced, states the MU circular.HIGHLIGHTS:*Repeater practical exam to begin from September 15 and written paper from September 25, 2020*Theory exams for fresh candidates to take place between October 1 to 17 (only for third year undergraduate students and post graduate part 2 students)*Exams will be held online in multiple choice questions (MCQ) format, each subject for 50 marks. The time limit for each online paper is one hour.*Handicap students will get 20 minutes extra, provided with a writer and other facilities as needed*Exams will only be held online but in case of any form of trouble faced by students, the last option for only such cases who could not appear for exam in online mode will be allowed to appear for exam in offline mode*Colleges will have to conduct mock tests to ease students into the new exam format*Colleges should provide sample question paper to students as well*50 marks paper should be converted into the exam format as followed by the course (100 marks theory or 75 marks theory paper)*Due to any untoward circumstances, if a student is unable to appear for any exam, then the college should ensure such a student is given the opportunity to appear for the exam on a later date*Students will not have the option of re-evaluation in the MCQ-format of exam*Colleges will have to start a helpline number for students, to counsel and relieve stress of students*Colleges will also have to conduct an online survey to find out exactly where all their students are at present, and what gadgets (mobile phone, laptop/desktop) and internet facilities are available for them to find out how many can conveniently appear for online exams

They are talking about the virus to create awareness among people through electronic media,” Mahapatra said.“Our concern was to control the spread of the virus as we know India has seen a surge in the number of coronavirus cases. We are seeing some positive results in Odisha,” he added.The institute has contributed to the efforts of the Odisha government in battling the deadly virus by running four dedicated COVID Hospitals and two COVID Care Centres having a total of 2,200 beds.A standalone COVID Hospital with 725 beds, the largest in the state, is being run by SOA at Bhubaneswar while it was operating three other hospitals at Chandpur, Kendrapara and Talcher.The SOA-run COVID Care Centres are functioning at Jamujhari (500 beds) and Jatni (300 beds). All the hospitals are fully equipped to deal with the disease including ventilators.
Actor Chiranjeevi’s brother Naga Babu has tested positive for Covid-19. In an instagram post, he said that he doesn’t see testing positive for the virus as a suffering but as an opportunity to donate plasma after recovering.Taking to Instagram, Naga Babu wrote, “An infection doesn’t always have to be a suffering, you can always transform it into an opportunity to help fellow beings. Tested Covid-19 +ve. Will scuffle & strife through this and will be a plasma donor. #Covid warrior #plasmadonor (sic).”Naga Babu’s post was showered with ‘recover soon’ messages from fans and close friends. Chiranjeevi’s son-in-law Kalyaan Dhev took to the comments section and wrote, “Speedy recovery Nagababai (sic).” Naga Babu replied to him, “@kalyaan_dhev Speed is a sign of Love., Thanks for yours @kalyaan_dhev.”Mostly popular for playing character roles in over 200 Telugu films, Naga Babu is also a producer. He even bankrolled the Telugu film Orange with his nephew Ram Charan. He is also popular on television. He’s one of the judges on Telugu comedy show Jabardasth.Naga Babu recently denied reports about a biopic being planned on his brother’s life. He said in an interview to TV9 that his brother lives a very content and complete life. Even the minor struggles in the beginning of his career don’t really warrant a film to be made on his life. “When it comes to Savitri, Silk Smitha and Sanjay Dutt, their lives were full of struggles and controversies. Their personal lives were not peaceful. That’s why films on their lives deserved to be made and did extremely well at the box-office. My brother Chiru, on the other hand, leads a fantastic and complete life whether it is onscreen and off-screen,” said Nagababu.

Updated: Sep 16, 2020 13:48 ISTOver the last few months, the Hindi film industry has been in spotlight for all the wrong reasons. As talks around nepotism, favouritism and insider vs outsider debate, seem far from getting over, Nidhhi Agerwal, too agrees that biases exist in Bollywood, but she doesn’t let that affect her career path.“My dad is into business and quite established. But I decided to pursue acting. Had I joined him I would’ve become the CEO of the company and things would’ve been easier for me. So of course star kids too have a lot of benefits. They also get good advice from people around them. You need someone to guide you otherwise you end up taking wrong decisions and that doesn’t really help,” she says.The 25-year-old, however, admits that nepotism exists and he’s aware that it’s always going to be there.“But that doesn’t mean I can’t become a star. It’ll take time but I’ll prove myself. I’m on my path already. Had I been a star kid, things would’ve been easier, but I don’t want to think it’s difficult either,” she adds.Grateful for the kind of work she got to do in the last three years, the actor says she can’t sit at home and cry thinking about all these.“If you’re hard-working and meant to be loved by millions, you’ll have it. All our paths are different. I look up to Aishwarya Rai [Bachchan], Priyanka Chopra [Jonas]… they’re outsiders too, who’re extremely successful… I’m doing well in South and have Hindi film offers too. I’ve just started. I definitely don’t want to think myself as a victim. I still have time to prove myself,” says Agerwal, who started her career with the Bollywood project Munna Michael (2017). The film however failed to make a mark at the box office.After that she did Tamil and Telugu films. In fact, she has two more upcoming films in both the languages. Her Tamil film co-starring Jayam Ravi is expected to release this year.Asked whether she feels creating a space in Bollywood is difficult, and she quips, “My first film was with Tiger Shroff and Nawazuddin Siddiqui and it did break even business. So you do get opportunities, although few. Of course it’s difficult where there’s so much competition. Everyone wants to get that one good film and become the next big thing. But if I start thinking negative I won’t be able to get out of my house and be excited to work.”Ready to get back to shoot October onwards, Agerwal, says, “After these six months, I’m keeping every good and bad things behind and starting in a new way. I’m really happy to be going back to the sets.”Author tweets @Shreya_MJ
Updated: Sep 20, 2020 08:37 ISTJuventus are unlikely to sign Barcelona and Uruguay forward Luis Suarez after all, coach Andrea Pirlo said Saturday as he prepared for the start of the new Serie A season.Pirlo, who replaced Maurizio Sarri last month despite having no senior coaching experience, will make his debut at home to Sampdoria on Sunday. He said that Juventus needed a centre-forward but that there was not enough time for Suarez to obtain an Italian passport.Juventus have already used up their limit of two non-EU signings following the arrival of Brazilian midfielder Arthur and U.S. international Weston McKinnie and would only be able to add Suarez if he can obtain an EU passport.“We’re all waiting for a centre forward. There is still a long way to go in the transfer window so we’re calm and happy, we’re not in a hurry,” said Pirlo.“Suarez is difficult because it takes a long time to get the passport, so it’s unlikely that it could be him”.Although Suarez is eligible for Italian naturalisation as his wife is a citizen of the country, the process usually takes several years - a detail overlooked in much of the speculation linking him to the Serie A champions over the last month.Pirlo said that Cristiano Ronaldo and Dejan Kulusevski would share the role against Sampdoria.“Neither Kulusevski nor Ronaldo will start in the classic centre forward position, they will try to move according to what the other does,” said Pirlo. “There will be rotations to allow as many people as possible to arrive in the area.”The 41-year-old said he was relaxed ahead of the new season where he will be expected, at the minimum, to bring Juventus a tenth successive Serie A title.“After a month of Juve I have no doubts, but many certainties,” he said. “I have fitted in well, now the pitch will do the talking.”
A group of scientists sent a formal letter to the Lancet on Monday outlining doubts about the accuracy of early data on Russia’s Covid-19 vaccine, one of the authors said, adding further fuel to a dispute surrounding the “Sputnik-V” shot.Fifteen scientists from five countries signed the letter presenting their concerns to the international medical journal, Enrico Bucci, biologist adjunct professor at Philadelphia’s Temple University, told Reuters.Reuters did not see the contents of the letter. The move nonetheless highlights growing concern among scientists about the safety and efficacy of the Sputnik-V vaccine, which the government approved for use before completing full human trials.The official letter came days after a larger group of scientists - including the 15 - signed an open letter to the Lancet’s editor, published on Bucci’s personal blog, after the journal published the early-stage trial results from Moscow’s Gamaleya Institute.They said they found patterns in the Phase I/II data, which was peer-reviewed in the journal, that looked “highly unlikely”, with multiple participants reporting identical antibody levels.The Gamaleya Institute did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the formal letter sent on Monday.Last week the institute rejected the critique contained in the open letter, which was initially signed by 26 scientists but now has 38 signatories.“The published results are authentic and accurate and were examined by five reviewers at The Lancet,” Denis Logunov, a deputy director at the institute, said in a statement.He said his institute submitted the entire body of raw data on the trial results to The Lancet.The Lancet said it had invited the authors of the Russian vaccine study to respond to the questions raised in the open letter by Bucci.“We continue to follow the situation closely,” it added.Alexey Kuznetsov, Russian assistant health minister, told the Interfax news agency on Sept. 10 that the Gamaleya Institute had already sent detailed answers to the Lancet’s editor.‘RESULTS ARE PLAUSIBLE’Bucci said the blog published last week had drawn wide international support.“We started with about a dozen of us and now we have reached three times the signatures, with colleagues from the United States, Switzerland, Australia, India, Russia, Great Britain, Japan, Germany, Canada,” Bucci said.He said the formal letter to the Lancet was signed only by 15 scientists with expertise in virology, immunology, pharmaceutical development, research integrity and statistical analysis. Most were Italian, but they also included scientists from Sweden, Britain, the United States and Japan, he added.“The journal’s editor wrote asking us to send him our points of objections and inviting the authors of Russian vaccine’s study to respond to our points,” said Bucci.Naor Bar-Zeev, deputy director at John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who peer-reviewed the Russian data, last week defended his analysis of the research following the publication of the blog.“The results are plausible, and not very different to those seen with other AdV vectored products,” he said.The researchers had provided more detail than was needed for the review and responded to his questions “intelligently and in a matter-of-fact and confident but understated manner”.The results of the Russian Phase I/II trials, which involved 76 participants and was conducted in June-July, were published in the Lancet on Sept. 4. They showed that participants developed a positive immune response and no serious side effects, the study’s authors said.A Phase III trial, involving 40,000 participants, was launched on Aug. 26. Around 31,000 people have already subscribed to take part, Health Minister Mikhail Murashko said.

Officials of the secondary and basic education departments of Uttar Pradesh will work together as part of a joint initiative to put a check on children dropping out of schools.As part of a unique state-wide initiative to be undertaken across all 75 districts, these officials will ensure that all successful class 8 students of upper primary schools, including government-run, government-aided and unaided institutions, enrol in class 9 this year to continue studies, officials said.This step is being taken by the state government to put a stop on the high count of students who drop out of schools in UP at this level, they add.Director (Basic Education) Sarvendra Vikram Bahadur Singh has sent a missive in this regard.“I have instructed all block education officers to implement this order on a priority and intimate regarding the steps undertaken,” said Praygraj basic shiksha adhikari (BSA) Sanjay Kumar Kushwaha while confirming the development.As part of the initiative, principals/headmasters of the over 55,000 upper primary schools – including government-run and government-aided ones – will prepare a list of students of class 8 passing out of their respective institutions this year and also mark details regarding students among them who have taken admission in class 9, he said. The wardens will prepare this information at Kasturba Gandhi Residential Girls’ Schools running in the state, he added. The missive makes plain that principals of government-aided and non-aided schools will prepare and provide information to the district inspectors of schools (DIOSs) while the department of basic education will also make its information available to the respective DIOSs. The DIOSs will then provide the information received from both sources to the camp office of the state director (secondary education), Lucknow.After analysing the data, the two departments will zero in on students who after passing class 8 have failed to take admission in class 9 and then undertake a special drive to get all such students enrolled in schools so that they continue their education.Under the right to education (RTE), education till class 8 is free but class 9 onwards parents have to bear the cost of not just the school fee but also books, school uniforms, school bags etc and a large number of students end up discontinuing studies.According to an estimate, the net enrolment rate (NER) in UP at the elementary level is 79.86%— 9 percentage points lower than the all India average of 88.94%. The state has an annual dropout rate of 8.58% at the primary level, which is the 6th highest in the country and more than double the all India average of 4.13%. Also, the state’s primary to upper-primary transition rate of 79.1% is the 4th lowest in the country—11.04 percentage points below the national average of 90.14%.
Stand-up comedian Kunal Kamra recently dropped a sarcastic comment on Kangana Ranaut’s thoughtful quote about how it takes a “strong spiritual core” to recognise the delusion between the reel and real world. This led to a heated argument between the two. While Kangana went on to call herself a “revolutionary”, Kunal went a step ahead and shared a new definition of the word.Kangana had shared a picture of herself Wednesday morning on her team’s Twitter account along with a quote, “Show business is absolutely intoxicating, this make believe world of lights and camera is designed to make one live and believe in an alternate reality, a little bubble of their own, it takes a very strong spiritual core to recognise this delusion.”Wisdom via showman Jagga Jasoos AKA @SadhguruJV https://t.co/JDrQVKJYt4 — Kunal Kamra (@kunalkamra88) September 16, 2020Alleging that the words of wisdom by Kangana were actually inspired from Sadhguru, of whom the actor is an ardent follower The actor hit back at Kunal and said, “These fools are desperate to credit my struggles, intellect, spiritual depth, guts, success and achievements to some powerful man, how it hurts their fragile egos and cotton balls to admit that I am my own person, leading my life on my own terms. DEAL WITH IT Slightly smiling face.”Kunal again took a dig at Kangana, this time targeting her for her newly provided Y-plus security by the central government. He said, “I am wondering how a strong women like you can have Y - security where men are protecting you just for living life on your own terms...”I am wondering how a strong women like you can have Y - security where men are protecting you just for living life on your own terms...🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽 https://t.co/nxoyBh7YVI — Kunal Kamra (@kunalkamra88) September 16, 2020Justifying her security arrangement, Kangana replied to Kunal, “In a democracy it is the duty of the constitution to protect a revolutionary voice. Here in this case you see two aspects of the glorious democracy ‘The protector’ and ‘ The protected’. You will never make it to any of them. Be someone who means something to this nation Slightly smiling face.”Kunal again hit back at her by coining a new definition of “revolutionary”. He tweeted, “New definition of revolutionary - 1) Call Karan Johar an idiot 2) Selectively attack the government of a single state 3) Consume Jagga ka H***a for spiritual depth 4) Join the “casteless” upper-caste casteist tribe. Aur bhi dukh hai zamane main BJP ki mohabbat ke siva (there are many more worries in the world other than being in love with BJP).”
Swara Bhasker has taken umbrage to Kangana Ranaut’s rebuttal to Jaya Bachchan’s speech in Parliament on Tuesday, in which she accused certain members of the film industry of biting the hand that feeds them. Swara called Kangana’s response ‘sickening’ and reminded her that respecting one’s elders is the first lesson in Indian culture.In a tweet, Swara wrote, “Sickening Kangana. Shameful comment! Bas karo please. Apne zehen ki gandagi khud tak seemit rakho, gaali deni hai toh mujhe do… Main tumhari bakwasein khushi khushi sunungi aur yeh keechad kushti ladungi tumhare saath. Badon ki izzat bharatiya sanskriti ka pehla sabak hai - aur tum toh kathit rashtravadi ho (Please stop this. Keep the filth in your mind to yourself or abuse me if you want… I will happily listen to your nonsense and wrestle in the mud with you. Respecting one’s elders is the first lesson in Indian culture, and you say you are a nationalist).”On Wednesday, Kangana said that Bollywood offered two-minute roles, item numbers and one measly romantic scene, that too after the casting couch. She claimed that she was the one who brought feminism and patriotism in Hindi films.“Kaun si thali di hai Jaya ji aur unki industry ne? Ek thali mili thi jisme do minute ke role, item numbers aur ek romantic scene milta tha, woh bhi hero ke saath sone ke baad. Maine iss industry ko feminism sikhaya, thali deshbhakti naripradhan filmon se sajayi. Yeh meri apni thali hai, Jaya ji, aapki nahi (What plate is Jaya referring to? The one that was offered was to appear in a two-minute role, a romantic scene, item numbers -- and that too after sleeping with the hero? I taught the industry feminism, decorated the plate with patriotic and women-centric films. This is my own plate Jaya ji, not yours),” she wrote on Twitter.On Tuesday, she had written after the veteran actor’s speech in the Rajya Sabha, “Jaya ji would you say the same thing if in my place it was your daughter Shweta beaten, drugged and molested as a teenage, would you say the same thing if Abhieshek complained about bullying and harassment constantly and found hanging one day? Show compassion for us also.”Also see | Sanjay Dutt jets off to Dubai with Maanayata, gets special surprise on the flight. See picsJaya, on Tuesday, drew the Rajya Sabha’s attention to the negative portrayal of the film industry by some of its members. “People in the entertainment industry are being flogged by social media. People who made their names in the industry have called it a gutter. I completely disagree. I hope that the government tells such people not to use this kind of language. Jis thali mein khate hai usme chhed karte hai. Galat baat hai (they bite the hand that feeds, it’s wrong),” she said.Kangana had earlier called the film industry a ‘gutter’ and claimed that an overwhelming majority engages in drug use. She has also been attacking the ‘mafia’ in Bollywood, which supposedly works to destroy careers of outsiders such as herself and Sushant Singh Rajput.
Actor Dipika Chikhlia, best known for her role as Sita in Ramanand Sagar’s Ramayana, recently lost her mother and has now shared an emotional post about their time together and a lost opportunity. Dipika’s mother died last week and the actor has written about how she could not gift her mom one small thing that she wished for.Sharing a collage of pictures of her mom and herself, Dipika wrote on Instagram, “Story of a bag . My mum liked one of my bags ,so I asked to take it and use she found the bag a lilttle dirty so wanted to wash it with detergent,I told her mum this is a branded bag you can’t ,I will get it cleaned at a service centre meantime use it ... my daughters called my mum Aaji . They both thought it was cute that she wants to wash the bag ...cutting the story short ..she dint take it ....last month I opened my cupboard and saw the bag remembered the incident ,made a quick mental note to just let her have it ..the bag is not more important then her ...but now I lost the moment and feel sick in the stomach looking at the bag ,.....I missed the moment ...life is soo filled with such moments that we miss . Sorry mum :( #mum#life#bag#story#memory#stories#moveon#relationship#child#childhood.”Dipika had shared the news of her mother’s death with her fans. She wrote in a note accompanied by a picture of her mom. “In loving memory of Alkaben Rajeshbhai Chikhlia. She left a trail of joy and laughter everywhere she went. Finding happiness in even the smallest things in life. When she smiled, we would all smile. She would play with the youngest and tickle the brains of the wisest. A strong Independent woman, light years ahead of her time, she gave us wisdom to lead our lives with strength and inspired us to live our lives to the fullest.”“She always saw the brightest side even on a rainy day, Let’s remember her for always bringing a smile to our faces and cherish the memories we’ve created together.Let us all keep her in our prayers,” Dipika added. She wrote alongside the note, “RIP mum.”Dipika is back in the limelight ever since Ramayan rerun on Doordarshan during the lockdown earlier this year. While she essayed the role of Sita in the serial, she had claimed she would have rather played Kaikeyi in the story. “If today somebody would have offered me, I would have possibly done Kaikeyi, this is how much we have changed as actors (laughs). As an actor, it is exactly opposite playing a negative role. If I have to play a role, I will like to try playing a role where I have a dimension, where I can explore myself as a creative person,” she had said.
In India’s complex institutional architecture, the judiciary occupies a special place. It is the upholder of the Constitution and the final arbiter of justice. It evokes faith due to its rigour and independence. It protects citizens from the excesses of the State, ensures that the political system cannot use an electoral mandate to change the basic structure of the Constitution, settles disputes between the Centre and states, between states, between the State and citizens, and among citizens.These have helped reinforce the reputation of the courts, especially the Supreme Court (SC), as truly independent. And that is why it is disappointing to see SC hold senior advocate and activist Prashant Bhushan guilty of contempt. Mr Bhushan had posted two separate tweets — one in which he accused SC, and especially the past four Chief Justices of India, of aiding the “destruction” of democracy, and another in which he made a personal remark about the Chief Justice in the context of courts remaining locked down. This newspaper does not endorse the content of either of Mr Bhushan’s tweets, but the issue here is the manner in which court has dealt with the issue, which is more about individuals and less about the court itself.There is a certain rationale for the provision of contempt. But for it to have legitimacy and effectiveness, it must be used in rare circumstances — when the State or citizens refuse to abide by the order of the court, when there is clear evidence of obstruction of justice, and when the court itself is being targeted. A 2012 United Kingdom (UK) Law Commission report provides an excellent template in this regard, where it recommended that the offence of “scandalising the court” was an infringement of freedom of expression that should not be retained; this was subsequently implemented by the UK Parliament. In India too, contempt must not apply to criticism of judges because that doesn’t necessarily mean criticism of the court. And even criticism of the court should be allowed. If citizens point out what they think is a shortcoming of the court — be it in terms of how it is prioritising cases or adopting a certain process of jurisprudence or the logical inconsistencies in a certain order — allow it. These criticisms may not always be well-reasoned or even fair, but it is through discussion in the public sphere that institutions become stronger and democracy thrives. The apex court needs to have a far more liberal interpretation of the contempt provision, even as it safeguards the sanctity of the judicial process.
Updated: Sep 13, 2020 09:07 ISTLegendary Pakistan batsman Zaheer Abbas named an Indian batsman he ‘really likes’. Abbas heaped praise on India’s limited-overs vice-captain Rohit Sharma and termed him a ‘classical player.’“Rohit Sharma is a classical player. I really like him. He creates strokes, plays on the merit of the ball,” said Abbas in a YouTube show called Caught Behind.Abbas who is widely renowned as the ‘Asian Bradman’ for scoring 108 first-class centuries, said he always keeps an eye on how Rohit hits the boundaries.“My eyes look at how he creates strokes, how he hits his sixes and boundaries. The players who have such a wide range of strokes can play in all formats, he rarely fails,” said Abbas.READ | ‘In 2010-11, Virat Kohli was a brat like me’: Shoaib Akhtar hails India captain’s growthThe former Pakistan captain also highlighted Rohit’s evolution as an all-format batsman and said he can be successful in Test cricket if he makes the mental adjustments.“If you mentally prepare for Tests, then you play accordingly, same is with ODIs and T20Is, it’s all about tuning your mind and Rohit has all the shots, so he doesn’t have to worry about that,” he added.India's Rohit Sharma celebrates his century during the third and final ODI cricket match against Australia, at Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru, Sunday, Jan. 19, 2020. ( PTI )Abbas, who scored 5062 runs in 78 Tests at an average of 44.79, cited the example of India limited-overs vice-captain Rohit Sharma and said if Pakistan batsmen feel he is good then they should follow him.“If you say that Rohit Sharma is good. Then you should learn from him. Watch him, see how he plays, observe his technique. I used to watch and learn from Hanif Mohammad, Rohan Kanhai. I didn’t go and train with them, I just learned after observing their batting,” he said.Rohit, who was awarded the highest award for sportspersons in India the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna, will lead Mumbai India in IPL 2020. The defending champions will play the tournament opener on September 19 against last year’s runner-up Chennai Super Kings in Abu Dhabi.
Saqib Saleem and Shweta Basu Prasad have united to play an onscreen couple in Comedy Couple.They navigate the ups and downs of the their love life by joking about it on stage. They play standup comedians who draw inspiration for their scripts from their own real-life experiences. Comedy Couple‘s teaser was released on Saturday.The teaser opens with Saqib (Deep) and Shweta (Zoya) as they take to the stage for their comedy act. Saqib begins the act by sharing his theory about relationships by breaking it into three stages. He says the first stage is like a chilled beer which should be consumed in time and if it is left around, it gets warm and eventually loses fizz, much like most relationships.The teaser also hints at Saqib’s character’s habit of telling lies, which often lands him in trouble. After a few glimpses from their real-life, the teaser ends with their stage act where Saqib vents out his frustration on stage and the two end the act of the day together.Talking about the romantic-comedy, Saqib said, “From me and mine i.e. Deep and Zoya, I think at this time we all need a double dose of Comedy Couple and not take life too seriously, for an hour or so. The timing is perfect, giving people a chance to sit back, relax and enjoy. Zoya and Deep’s real-life escapades are enough for them to add fizz to their comic act on stage. We have shot the entire film during the pandemic and I hope people enjoy the teaser and the glimpse of our fruit of labour.”Shweta added, “The whole experience of shooting Comedy Couple has been so rewarding, every single minute of the shoot has been memorable. We have all worked incredibly hard to bring forth a concept like this and we do hope that people will love it as much as we loved shooting for it. The best part about the film is that it is extremely relatable, and I can guarantee that couples out there will find a little bit of themselves in Deep and Zoya’s story. It is definitely a light watch, especially considering the times that we live in. We want everyone to chill, relax and hop on with us on this fun ride.”Directed by Nachiket Samant the film is produced by Yoodlee Films – the film production arm of Saregama India. Comedy Couple is based on a story by Bikas Mishra with screenplay by Raghav Kakkar and Kashyap Kapoor. It will release on ZEE5 Premium on October 21.

The actor posted a heartfelt note on Instagram, thanking her for being so ‘supportive and understanding’.Hrithik had written, “It is unimaginable for me, as a parent, to think of having to be separated from my children at a time when the country is practicing lockdowns.” He thanked Sussanne for temporarily moving in with him, so that their sons were ‘not disconnected indefinitely from either one of us’.Hrithik, Sussanne and the Roshans celebrated a number of occasions together during the coronavirus pandemic, including their son Hrehaan’s birthday, Rakesh Roshan’s birthday and Ganesh Chaturthi.Hrithik and Sussanne ended their marriage of more than 13 years and got divorced in 2014.

Updated: Sep 16, 2020 16:17 ISTKaran Johar was seen at a private airport in Mumbai with his mother, Hiroo Johar, and twins Yash and Roohi on Tuesday evening. According to reports, the Johars flew to Goa. The filmmaker wore a leopard print camo jacket with a black mask, which said, “If you’re reading this, you’re too close.”Deepika Padukone flew to Goa earlier this month to shoot for Shakun Batra’s next, which is being produced by Karan. The film, which is said to be a ‘domestic noir’, also features Siddhant Chaturvedi and Ananya Panday.Recently, Karan announced his new project, a picture book for children titled The Big Thoughts of Little Luv. This is not the first time he is dabbling in writing; in 2017, he co-wrote his memoir An Unsuitable Boy with Poonam Saxena.Also see | Sanjay Dutt jets off to Dubai with Maanayata, gets special surprise on the flight.

Thank you @mrsfunnybones for introducing me to the wonderful @Chikisarkar @juggernautbook.”Karan also shared a video, which revealed that his experience of being a father to twins Yash and Roohi inspired him to write The Big Thoughts of Little Luv. “This charming funny book looks at how we impose differences between girls and boys as we raise them. Beautifully illustrated, this book tells the story of twins, Luv and Kusha, as they try to understand gender, and the ways in which we treat boys and girls differently,” the text in the video read.Karan has been maintaining a low profile on social media after the death of Sushant Singh Rajput in June this year. Karan has been trolled relentlessly and accused of using his influence in the film industry to further the careers of star kids, with Sushant’s fans believing that he was shunned for being an outsider.

This story has been told before, towards the start of Mahendra Singh Dhoni (MSD)’s international career; so it is perhaps fitting that it’s told again, now that we are at the end of it.In April 2005, in the middle of a hot and hectic one-day series against Pakistan, the cricket carnival shuffled into Visakhapatnam. It was an Indian team that featured a bunch of fresh players, and among them was a wicketkeeper-batsman who wore the same long hair that I did at the time (don’t ask; we were all young and foolish once).As a travelling cricket writer then, this similarity in manes led to a series of interesting encounters. I was greeted at the airport with chants of “Dhoni, Dhoni” by a large group of fans waiting for the Indian team to arrive; crushed by autograph-seekers at the hotel where both the team and I were staying; and cheered in the hotel balcony by another throng that assembled on the beachfront across the road. I must confess that I waved back, relishing this misdirected attention.The following morning, things changed forever.MSD, 23, exploded into national consciousness with an imperious 148 — 123 deliveries, 15 fours, four sixes; scaling the roof of the new stadium at least twice (the jury is still out whether it was three times).He would not be confused for anyone ever again, long hair or not; and would go on to become India’s most influential public figure of the next decade-and-a-half.Right through this journey, which effectively began that morning in Visakhapatnam, Dhoni was a complicated figure that India really could not get a handle on. His is a story of many contrasts — a subject of both intrigue and fascination, radiating both charm and abrasiveness, reacting with both passion and disengagement, providing moments of both unconfined joy and unadulterated anguish, and donning the role of both rebel and dictator. Not surprising then, that his cricketing legacy is both illustrious and problematic.It’s not easy to capture what MS Dhoni means to cricket — he was not the greatest of batsmen, but could be the most effective; he wasn’t the safest of wicketkeepers, but came up with game-changing dismissals; nor was he, despite his phenomenal success, the most talismanic of captains. There are enough contenders in each of those categories — both in India and abroad — against whom Dhoni would not be able to hold his own.It’s perhaps even harder to capture what he means to India, and why he transcended sport to become a public figure. He went far beyond the confines of the boundary line on the cricket field, or for that matter, any other boundaries that society could have enclosed him in.He was never meant to succeed in the manner that he did. A boy from Ranchi, ticket-collector by profession, and wicketkeeper-batsman by hobby — the fact that he played in the state Ranji team was a good enough end to the script. Nothing more was needed. But somehow his story didn’t stop there: He made it to the Indian side, led it, won two World Cups, and then fashioned an entire generation of dreamers in the same manner that Sachin Tendulkar had done in the previous decade.Tendulkar, whose career started around the same time India was being liberalised, became the talisman of a nation starting to exhale. His was the face that launched a million brands, each feeding on his power and drawing from his excellence. He was the perfect fit for that time — a boy from a literary, respected, yet financially modest family — encompassing the dreams and hopes that India had from new opportunities that would come with opening its doors to the world.Dhoni, though we did not realise it at the time, was the perfect fit to carry Tendulkar’s baton. He took flight at a time, 15 years after liberalisation, when small-town India was just getting ready to soar. Dhoni’s rise was a physical manifestation of the aspirations of hitherto neglected non-city slickers, and the first proof of their ability to achieve whatever they set their hearts on. He was, in many ways, the first hero of “real India”.It was in the wake of Dhoni that others from this “real India” started breaking out. And — though not directly linked to him, but a reflection of the times — that real-estate prices began rising in B-towns, shopping malls starting dotting their landscape, and stories about life in these places started being told in Hindi cinema, which was until then enthralled by rich romances in foreign locations.Dhoni’s public life, of course, went through several pit stops — not all of them welcome. On the field, he triumphed as a skipper in the 2007 T20 World Cup, won the 2011 World Cup final off his own bat, and bid farewell (not always graciously) to a generation of greats he shared the dressing-room with. Off the field, he backed the players he believed in, even though they did not always meet the approval of experts, was accused of effectively setting up a player agency that went against all conflict-of-interest tenets, and developed a too-close bond with former cricket board chief N Srinivasan, even after he was mired in a myriad controversies.These highs and lows notwithstanding, the importance of Dhoni, the phenomenon, far outweighed that of Dhoni, the cricketer. He means something extraordinary to cricket, and to India, even though we may not be able to fully capture what that is.kunal.pradhan@hindustantimes.comThe views expressed are personal
Anil Kapoor and Jackie Shroff engaged in a rare banter on Twitter on Saturday after a news article about them not doing any film together surfaced online. While Jackie said he is always ready to do a film with Anil, the latter said no one could cast an evil eye on their hit jodi.Ram Bhai, apni jodi ko sab nazar laga rahe hain...par lagegi nahi!Love You @bindasbhidu 🤗 https://t.co/Vfp3B64fUu pic.twitter.com/eATFJr2ueg — Anil Kapoor (@AnilKapoor) September 19, 2020Jackie came across a news article which quoted a source close to him as saying that the actor had no film with Anil in the pipeline. Reacting to the article, Jackie wrote on Twitter, “Kya, kaun kuch bhi bolta hai....Lakhan production any role sar ankhon pey. Hugging face @AnilKapoor (People say whatever they feel like. For any film from Lakhan Production, may I say - your wish is my command).”In a while, Anil came to show some love to his onscreen and offscreen pal. He replied to him on Twitter, “Ram Bhai, apni jodi ko sab nazar laga rahe hain...par lagegi nahi! Love You @bindasbhidu (Brother Ram, everybody keeps eyeing our pairing...but no one can cast an evil eye on us).”Anil and Jackie are known as the famous Ram Lakhan of Bollywood. The two featured in several films together in the 1980s with Ram Lakhan (1989), Yudh (1985), Karma (1986), and Parinda (1989) being some of the most memorable ones.Several years ago, Jackie had told Hindustan Times in an interview, “I don’t know when our sons will get to work together in a film, but I believe that we still have the same screen presence. I really want to work with Anil again and show to the world that we can create the same magic that we used to in the ’80s.”Anil and Jackie continue to act in films even as their children have also joined the industry. While Jackie’s son Tiger Shroff is already counted as one of the most daring action heroes of Bollywood, Anil’s daughter Sonam Kapoor and son Harshvardhan Kapoor are also actors. His younger daughter Rhea Kapoor is a film producer.
Updated: Sep 10, 2020 15:50 ISTThe Supreme Court posted for hearing on September 14 a petition challenging the decision of the CBSE to conduct compartment exams for students of classes X and XII in September and urging for provisional admissions in universities.A three-judge bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and Sanjiv Khanna on Thursday directed the petitioner to serve the copies of the petition to the Union of India to consider their prayer for provisional admissions in universities from such students.Senior advocate Vivek Tankha, appearing for the petitioners, told the bench that usually compartment exams are held before college admissions take place.He said it’s understandable that the CBSE could not hold examinations in the beginning due to the COVID-19 situation. “Then there was a hybrid variety of exams and then results were declared and because of that, a lot of people were facing compartment exams,” Tankha added.The most important thing is that if students don’t get admission in colleges after the compartment exams are done, then their entire year gets wasted, Tankha contended, while urging the court to create some room for such students to get admission.Tankha sought that a direction be passed to give students provisional admissions in universities.Earlier on a similar plea, the CBSE had told the court that CBSE is likely to conduct compartment examination for students of classes X and XII in September end and that the number of examination centres have been increased to 1,278.
The Centre has decided to postpone the National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2020 by one year amid a surge in coronavirus cases in the country.The NAS, which was initially scheduled to be held in November 2020 to assess the learning levels of students, will now be held around the same time next year. “Due to current prevailing pandemic situation in the country, it has been decided to postpone NAS to 2021,” according to a communication sent by Union ministry of education director JP Pandey last week to principal secretaries, school education, of all the states and union territories.The central ministry has tentatively scheduled the survey for classes 3, 5, 8, and 10 during the first week of October or second week of November 2021, asking the states and UTs to convey their preference by September 18. “As the survey involves all states and UTs, early finalization of dates would help stakeholders and other agencies involved in the conduct of NAS for a seamless and timely planning,” reads the letter. The postponement came as India’s Covid-19 tally raced past the 40 lakh-mark.The exercise will be conducted jointly by the Union ministry of education and the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) to evaluate class-appropriate learning competencies of students in state-run and aided schools, understand educational health of schooling, diagnose maladies, and institute measures to fill them. In the last survey held in November 2017, the learning levels of 25 lakh students of 1.10 lakh schools across 701 districts in all states and UTs were assessed.A senior official of Punjab’s school education department said there is no other option available as all schools are closed. “There is no plan to reopen schools for now as Covid-19 cases are rising across the country. Whenever any decision is taken, primary and middle school will be the last to be reopened,” he said. Punjab held the Punjab Achievement Survey (PAS) online last month for students of classes 6 to 12 to check the learning outcomes to prepare the teachers and students for the national achievement survey. In the 2017 survey, Punjab students had not fared well, particularly in mathematics even though they did better in languages.
Star Australia batsman Steve Smith has been cleared to take part in the second ODI against England after passing a second concussion test on Saturday.Smith was a late withdrawal from Friday’s first ODI, which Australia won by 19 runs to go 1-0 up in the three-match series, after sustaining a blow on the head in the nets from a throw-down by a coaching staff member on the eve of the match.The 31-year-old was withdrawn from the playing XI of the first ODI “as a precautionary measure.” However, Smith has passed the two concussion tests, one on Friday and the other on Saturday, according to cricket.com.au.“I think it was a good decision in the end. There’s no need to take unnecessary risks with head injuries,” all-rounder Mitch Marsh said.“It probably gives our selection committee a few headaches now because the top order struck them beautifully, without getting a big score. Anytime you’ve got Steve Smith coming back into the team it’s a great feeling,” he added.Smith was also infamously felled by a Jofra Archer bouncer at Lord’s during last year’s Ashes. That knock caused him to miss the second innings of that Test and the following match as well.Left-arm seamer Mitchell Starc experienced some groin pain on Friday. He managed to complete his 10 overs after slipping on the field but is also expected to play on Sunday.“He’s a little bit sore but we’ll see how he pulls up and go from there,” Josh Hazlewood said.Australia are in with a chance to claim a bilateral ODI series win over England for the first time since 2015 and end the recent dominance by Eoin Morgan’s men in 50-over cricket. England have won 11 of their past 14 encounters against Australia.

Giving her company was her young son Taimur Ali Khan.Kareena was seen is a pair of printed blue and white co-ords, paired with pale pink stillettos.Taimur looked rather smart in a pair of denim jeans with a pale pink full shirt.

Thank you to all our well-wishers for all their love and support. - Saif and Kareena”Saif’s immediate family had reacted to news in different ways. While Saif’s elder son Ibrahim had reacted to aunt Soha Ali Khan’s post by simply writing ‘Abba’, while Soha had joked and posted a picture of her brother which said ‘The Quadfather’, a play of Hollywood classic The Godfather. She had written: “Coming soon!! Couldn’t resist! Congratulations @kareenakapoorkhan be safe and healthy - and radiant as ever.”Kareena’ dad Randhir Kapoor has been wanting his daughter to have another child for a while.

Faf du Plessis on Saturday stunned Hardik Pandya after picking a stunner in the deep during Mumbai Indian’s clash against Chennai Super Kings on the opening day of the 13th edition of Indian Premier League. The Proteas cricketer took two stunning catches back-to-back in the same over, but the one that got rid of Pandya was pure artistry.The moment took place in the 14th over when Ravindra Jadeja was bowling to Saurabh Tiwary and Hardik Pandya, who both were looking to go after the bowlers. In the first ball of the over, Tiwary went for a slog sweep on a length ball outside off stump, and the ball went straight to du Plessis at long-on.IPL 2020, MI vs CSK: Live score and updates🤭🤭🤭🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫 King du plessis second time pic.twitter.com/4mvpIyC88G — Ali_OO7_ (@Ali89430780) September 19, 2020The Proteas batsman lobbed the ball in the air as he was about to cross the boundary ropes, and then stepped out to take the ball comfortably, making it look easy.Four balls later, in the same over, Hardik Pandya smashed a delivery in the same area, and despite the ball being flat and towards Faf’s right at long-off, he sprinted and jumped up in the air to catch the ball before it goes over him for a six. Pandya looked stunned at the ‘Faf’-ulous catch by the fielder but had to walk back to the hut scoring just 14 runs.The two dismissals turned the tide of the match, as Mumbai Indians, who were looking to set a huge total on the board at one stage, could only muster 162/9 in 20 overs. Chennai Super Kings were asked to chase down 163 in the IPL 2020 opener.
Updated: Sep 13, 2020 10:14 ISTBabar Azam is one of the best batsmen in the world right now along with Virat Kohli, Steve Smith, and Kane Williamson. He has been incredibly consistent in the past few years, often fighting a lone battle in the Pakistan middle order. The 25-year-old was in good form in the recently concluded England tour where Pakistan lost the Test series 0-1 and tied the T20 series 1-1.Even though he has been consistently accumulating runs, Babar has been criticised for his slow strike-rate. Babar was recently the number one T20 batsmen in the world (before being displaced by Dawid Malan). But criticism has been levelled on him for not scoring runs quickly.Pakistan wicketkeeper-batsman Kamran Akmal defended Babar, saying that people should spend their energy motivating him rather than looking down on a player like him.Pakistan's Babar Azam in action. ( REUTERS )READ | Misbah reveals Sarfaraz Ahmed had reservations playing last T20I after being overlooked for almost entire England tour“An even greater tragedy is that people have started to criticize our number one batsman, Babar Azam, saying that he isn’t scoring runs at a fast-enough rate or isn’t winning enough games. What is becoming of us? If we wish to improve things then instead of looking down on a player like Babar, we should spend our energy motivating him,” Kamran said in an interaction with PakPassion.net,‘I feel that the team management needs to make sure that all players in the squad are looked after and given confidence instead of preferring to concentrate and spend energies on a select few who are their favourites,” added the 38-year-old, who remains out of contention despite being among runs in the domestic circuit.Babar hit 195 runs in the three-match Test series for Pakistan while hitting 77 runs in the T20s. A lot was expected out of Babar but he wasn’t at his absolute best at the tour.
India celebrated its 73rd anniversary of Independence on August 15. As Indians, we have a lot to be grateful for. But, there are also some worrying and dark aspects to our social milieu. While most of us are justifiably proud of our past, many of our compatriots are in a precarious position today, their distress exacerbated by the pandemic, their future uncertain.Let me narrate the story of Deepak Brahma, from Kokrajhar district in Assam. Due to the lack of employment opportunities in his native village, he went to Gujarat where he toiled to support his family. Covid-19 took his job away. Like many other migrant workers, he decided to return home to his village. As a daily wage earner, he had no savings since he had used everything he earned to sustain himself and his family. His family raised money by selling household items to enable him to return. After getting home, Brahma and others like him found that they were shunned in their villages. With no work and no money, and treated as possible carriers of the infection, they were treated as outcasts. When hunger overwhelmed Brahma and his family, he sold his newborn daughter for ~45,000 to feed his other two children for a while. But his misfortunes did not end there.A local NGO got wind of this and the matter finally came to the attention of the police. Brahma, the middleman and the buyer were packed off to jail. Impoverished and desperate, Brahma now faces a long and tough legal battle. Brahma’s story is similar to so many others across India, hardly an encouraging thought as the Republic enters its 74th year.It is staggering how quickly we forget the pain and suffering of others. Just a few months ago, our media was full of news about millions of migrant workers trudging home on the highways under the scorching sun after they lost their jobs in the cities. Hungry, thirsty, their soles cracked and bleeding, they marched on, clutching their meagre possessions and their children in the hope of finding some succour at home. Those going home included the elderly, the sick and pregnant women, a sight which was heart-rending and, for many of us, an appalling indictment of a system which had failed them. Most of us have only heard about the Partition of 1947. The outward migration when Covid-19 struck seemed like a replay of those terrible days.Mahatma Gandhi used to refer to these people as daridra-narayan (penniless gods). These are the people for whom Gandhi propounded the concept of Ram Rajya. This concept drove the spirit behind our freedom struggle. But what has happened to it today?Did governments at the Centre and states remain silent spectators during the calamity visited upon us by Covid-19? Not at all. During this period, coffers were opened and, as a result, there was no news of mass starvation despite enormous unemployment. Based on data, our sister publication Mint has done a comparative study. It found that under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Yojana, ~2,000 per month, as an advance quarterly instalment, was deposited into the accounts of millions of people. Free foodgrains were also distributed during this period. However, the same study also found that the urban poor were better off than rural communities. Those in rural areas were more deprived despite free foodgrains and the deposits of ~500 in the Jan Dhan accounts of women.In another survey, it was found that during the lockdown, people’s income decreased by 84%. When reporters from Hindustan reached a segment of these citizens, they came across a myriad of problems faced by those in the lower-middle and middle-income groups. Decreased income meant that their savings were depleted since these had to be used for daily expenses. The biggest problem for this class was that their sense of pride and dignity stopped them from standing in queues for free foodgrains. They hesitated from applying for work under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MNREGS), leaving them little choice but to use up their own limited funds.So, it is little wonder that those who went home to their villages now have no option but to return to the cities, which closed their gates to them in their moment of need. Three years ago, IndiaSpend analysed government data which showed that about 70% of farmer families are forced to spend more than they earn. Today, they have to spend twice what they earn. This means they are trapped in an endless cycle of debt. The only industry, if it can be called that, which is thriving, is money lending since it has upped its interest rates in the post-Covid-19 period.With the situation being so dire for so many of our fellow citizens, can we really call ourselves truly independent?But there is faint glimmer at the end of the dark tunnel. Just before we celebrated Independence Day, a survey found that 58% of Indians believe that we will overcome this economic crisis. History shows us that those who do not lose heart, those who never give up will eventually overcome all the vicissitudes that life throws up. And that should give us some hope.Shashi Shekhar is editor-in-chief, HindustanThe views expressed are personal

Get ready for a mad ride kyunki #YehDiwaliLaxmmiBombWaali #DisneyPlusHotstarMultiplex @advani_kiara.”The horror comedy is a remake of Tamil blockbuster film, Muni 2: Kanchana. Raghava Lawrence, who had helmed the original, will be making his Hindi directorial debut with this one. The film also stars Kiara Advani, Tusshar Kapoor, Sharad Kelkar, Ashwini Kalsekar and many others.The first look from the film showed Akshay applying kohl to his eyes. The other look showed an angry Akshay, dressed up as a woman in a sari and bangles, standing in front of a Hindu deity. In June, Akshay had unveiled another new look of his character on Instagram. The actor’s face can be seen rimmed in blue hues, as he is seen donning a big red bindi on his forehead. The poster read, “Jiss din sach main mere saamne bhoot aaya na...toh maa kasam chudiyaan pehen lunga. (The day a ghost will really appear in front of me...I swear, will wear bangles that day).” Akshay unveiled another spooky poster of the movie, wherein a lady is seen holding a trident as she poses in ‘Natraj’ posture while donning a red sari.While launching the first two looks of his upcoming horror-drama, Laxmmi Bomb by live interaction on Hotstar Disney Plus, Akshay had called the genre of the movie his “favourite” and a “passion project”, he said that he was looking forward to doing the film.
Randeep Hooda resumed work on his next, Radhe: Your Most Wanted Bhai, amid the coronavirus pandemic. The actor took to Instagram to share a picture of himself at a dubbing studio and expressed his excitement to be back in action. “Grateful to be back at work. #Radhe,” he wrote in his caption.One fan pointed out that every time Randeep collaborated with Salman Khan, who plays the titular role in Radhe: Your Most Wanted Bhai, the film was a success. “Salman+ Randeep, Kick-Super hit, Sultan-blockbuster, Radhe-All time blockbuster,” the user wrote. Another commented, “the star is back....shine bright.” A third wrote, “Damn excited! Can’t wait for Radhe.”Last month, Randeep underwent a leg surgery. He told Hindustan Times earlier this month, “My leg is healing, there’s no postoperative complication. I’ll be able to move around properly in a week’s time. My dad (Ranbir Hooda), who’s a doctor, was there during my operation and took care of everything.”Also see | Sanjay Dutt jets off to Dubai with Maanayata, gets special surprise on the flight.

However, that could not happen as theatres across the country were shut due to the pandemic. Reports suggest that it is now eyeing a Diwali release, but there is no confirmation, as theatres remain shuttered.Since 2009, Salman has come out with a film on Eid every year, with the exception of 2013. However, he was forced to break tradition this year, on account of the pandemic.Radhe: Your Most Wanted Bhai, directed by Prabhudeva, was rumoured to be a follow-up to Tere Naam or Wanted. However, at the trailer launch of Dabangg 3 last year, Salman said that this film is the ‘baap’ of Wanted.“The name Radhe was actually in Tere Naam and then after we used it in Wanted. But this is a completely different film. It has got nothing to do with Wanted. If we go in that format, toh yeh Wanted ka baap hai,” he said.
Race to find a vaccine for the novel coronavirus continues even as the pandemic has wreaked havoc across the world. While India has thus far reported a total of over 4.9 million cases of the disease, as per Union health ministry data, globally, there have been over 29 million cases of the disease thus far, as per worldometers.As various possible vaccines are trialled across the world, and people hope for a breakthrough, US businessman and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates on Tuesday called India a leading vaccine producer, adding India’s cooperation is needed to manufacture Covid-19 vaccine.Meanwhile, Adar Poonawalla, the chief executive of Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) expressed apprehension there won’t be enough vaccine for everyone in the world before 2024-end.Here are the latest developments in Covid-19 vaccine trials:• Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates on Tuesday expressed hope for a large-scale Covid-19 vaccine rollout in India next year. “All of us want to get a vaccine out in India as fast as we can, once we know that its very effective and very safe.• Poonawalla, whose SII is in partnership with five international firms-including AstraZeneca and Novovax-to develop a vaccine, said world will need around 15 billion doses of a Covid-19 vaccine, if it is a two-dose vaccine.• AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine trials have been put on hold in the US till at least midweek, pending a US investigation into a serious side effect in Britain, sources familiar with developments said.• The World Health Organisation (WHO), meanwhile, praised AstraZeneca’s decision to halt its Covid-19 vaccine trials, saying safety is always critical, crucial and has been looked at by AstraZeneca ‘in an appropriate manner.’• A Chinese official said vaccine may be available for public use in the country in November 2020.

With so much franchise cricket being played all around the world, team managements are on a constant look-out for talent for their sides. Even in the Indian Premier League, all the franchises scout different talents to discover the next superstar in cricket. There have been several players like David Warner or Hardik Pandya who made their name in the IPL before becoming global superstars.However, according to former India batsman, Gautam Gambhir feels there is one player who often gets neglected by teams despite impressive performances. Gambhir named Afghanistan all-rounder Mohammed Nabi as the most underrated player in T20 cricket. Nabi had a successful Caribbean Premier League (CPL) where he scored 156 runs and took 12 wickets for St Lucia Zouks.Sunrisers Hyderabad's bowler Mohammed Nabi prepares to bowl against Challengers Banglores during the VIVO IPL T20 cricket match in Hyderabad. ( AP )READ | IPL will set the momentum for Australia tour, says KXIP pacer Mohammed Shami“According to me, he is the most underrated player in T20 cricket. You talk about Kieron Pollard, AB de Villiers, Rashid Khan, or David Warner but if you see his contribution, he is a brilliant fielder, gives you four overs with the ball, bowls in the first 6 overs, bats at No.5 or No.6, and can play the big shots,” Gambhir said on Star Sports show Cricket Connected.“We talk about Andre Russell as a quality all-rounder but Mohammad Nabi probably may not be in that category but he is not that far behind. Because he comes from Afghanistan, who do not play that much cricket, so people do not rate him that much,” he addedGambhir also said that he does not many opportunities due to the presence of Warner, Jonny Bairstow, Rashid Khan, and Kane Williamson in the SRH squad. But he feels if played for 14 matches then everyone will come to know of his impact.“He is also in a franchise where you play David Warner, Jonny Bairstow, Rashid Khan, and Kane Williamson, so he does not get that many opportunities. If Mohammad Nabi was in some other franchise, he would have played all the 14 matches in the IPL. And if you play him in all the 14 matches of the IPL, you will come to know his impact,” said Gambhir.

The UN migration agency said Tuesday that a boat carrying migrants bound for Europe capsized in the Mediterranean Sea off Libya, leaving at least two dozen people drowned or missing and presumed dead, the latest shipwreck off the North African country.Safa Msehli, a spokesperson for the International Organization for Migration, told The Associated Press that Libya’s coast guard intercepted three boats on Monday, and one of them had capsized.She said the coast guard retrieved two bodies, and survivors reported 22 others were missing and presumed dead.At least 45 survivors on the three boats were returned to the shore. All migrants were men, with a majority from Egypt and Morocco, she said.“This new tragedy signals yet again the need for increased search and rescue capacity in the Mediterranean. Instead, we are seeing restrictions on NGOs and long, unnecessary stand-offs,” Msehli said.The shipwreck was the latest maritime disaster involving migrants seeking a better life in Europe.In August, a boat carrying dozens of migrants capsized leaving at least 45 people drowned or missing and presumed dead, marking the largest number of fatalities in a single shipwreck off the coast of the North African country.Libya, which descended into chaos following the 2011 uprising that toppled and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi, has emerged as a major transit point for African and Arab migrants fleeing war and poverty to Europe.

The IPL is the right kind of tournament that allows players to get into the groove nicely, an absolute must before they hit the Australian shores for two and half months, feels Indian team’s premier speedster Mohammed Shami.The Australia-bound India players will fly directly after the IPL concludes on November 10 for the much-anticipated tour which is likely to begin with a T20 series followed by four Tests and ODIs.“It would be great that the Australia-bound players are playing IPL. It will set the body and momentum perfectly by then,” the Kings XI pace spearhead told PTI in an exclusive interaction.Also Read | Full Coverage of IPLIndia under Virat Kohli achieved the historic feat of winning in Australia for the first time in 2018-19 but the hosts did not have Steve Smith and David Warner back then because of their involvement in the ball tampering scandal.The duo’s presence would make the series even more exciting and Shami said everyone is focused on the tour as well.“I feel it’s better that we are playing IPL before a big series. Apart from IPL, everyone is also focused on that tour (Down Under). There is a lot of talk about that series. We will have a good contest.”With the IPL shifted to the UAE, the tournament will be held across three venues of Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Sharjah, comprising 60 matches spread over 53 days.Also Read | Kevin Pietersen predicts the winner of IPL 2020Shami feels unlike in India where they have to fly all over the country for away matches, the IPL in UAE would be less hectic this time.“Yes, there’re back to back matches, training, travelling that’s a bit of headache. But it’s a short format, short matches, physically there should not be any workload issue. This time, there won’t be much travelling. You will have to travel just about two hours by bus (when there is a match in Abu Dhabi).”With R Ashwin joining Delhi Capitals, Kings XI’s bowling responsibility will be shouldered by the seasoned Indian pacer and Shami said he’s up to the challenge and would look to take the key wickets of their opponents.“I always try to stand up to the role and give my 100 per cent. I will bowl as per the situation depends... “Obviously being the strike bowler, it’s important to take the key wickets it gives a big relief to the team,” the seasoned pro, with 49 Tests, 77 ODIs and 11 T20Is under his belt, said.This time, Kings XI have appointed Anil Kumble as the director of cricket operations as the former India head coach.Also Read | ‘CSK’s first option was Sehwag, they went for Dhoni after he chose Delhi’“I’ve a great bonding with him. It’s very important to have a good bonding with the coach, you can explain things clearly and it’s all about having a clear understanding.”Asked about spin legend Shane Warne’s suggestion of giving a maximum five overs to a bowler in T20s instead of the current four, the veteran pacer didn’t endorse the idea.“We are used to the current set of rules. I don’t think it will make any difference. The format is always heavily stacked up against the bowlers.”KXIP have been perennial underachievers and barring two seasons -- 2008 and 2014 -- they have failed to make the playoffs and finished last thrice (2010, 2015 and 2016).Shami however said that any team should discount KXIP at its own peril.“You cannot underestimate any team in this format. It’s been our bad luck that we have not been able to lift the trophy yet. We had a great start last season. T20 format is all about execution. Our stroke of luck can change any moment.”
Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap recently tweeted about late actor Sushant Singh Rajput and how he ‘ghosted’ him a couple of times after agreeing to a project. The first time it happened was during Hasee Toh Phasee, which released in 2014. In a recent interview, Anurag shared more details about all that happened behind the scenes.Anurag has previously talked about how he had roped in Sushant for Hasee Toh Phasee but he went ahead and signed a three film deal with Yash Raj Films. His first film with them was Shuddh Desi Romance co-starring Parineeti Chopra. However, Anurag has now said that Parineeti earlier did not want to work with Sushant.Speaking to journalist Faye D’Souza, Anurag said, “He was supposed to do the film (Hasee Toh Phasee) and we had to find an actress and we reached out to Parineeti Chopra. She said ‘I don’t want to work with a television actor’. So we explained to her that who Sushant Singh is, he is doing Kai Po Che, he is doing PK and by the time Hasee Toh Phasee comes out, he will not just be a television actor. And she was doing a film called Shuddh Desi Romance and she must have gone and spoken to YRF, they called him and said ‘Why don’t you come and do Shuddh Desi Romance and not do that film?’ And he disappeared on us.”Anurag said that everyone understood that going with YRF was a better deal for Sushant and so not one opposed him for it. Sushant worked with Parineeti in Shuddh Desi Romance while she worked with Sidharth Malhotra in Hasee Toh Phasee.Sushant allegedly ghosted Anurag again in 2016. “Years later, in 2016, before the release of MS Dhoni: The Untold Story, Mukesh went to Sushant and said, ‘Anurag has written a script looking for an actor who can play someone based out of Uttar Pradesh.’ Dhoni released, became a success and he never called me back. I was not upset, I moved on, I did Mukkabaaz,” the filmmaker said in an interview to NDTV.Anurag also said in his interview to Faye: “Sushant Singh Rajput had six blockbusters. It would take another four years of films not working for him to written off totally. A lot of people at that time didn’t know what he was going through. It is only now that it has come out that he was dealing with depression. But the problem the industry had with him at that time was that he was ghosting people. The problem was not that he would misbehave. People who would meet him would say Sushant Singh Rajput is a great boy, who behaves very well, who is sensitive, who is nice. But he would jut ghost and disappear.”Anurag added that he knows Sushant was trying to change this part of him. He changed his agencies, moved from YRF to Corner Stone. Anurag said that Sushant’s new manager reached to him three weeks before the actor’s death, asking for work. He said that Sushant told his manager ‘If you take my name to Anurag, he won’t answer your call’. Anurag believes that Sushant was also feeling guilty for disappearing on him.

With the laying of the foundation stone of the Ram mandir reopening the debate on the role of religion in India, a new book has suggested that the traditions of all its religions can provide the grounds for religious tolerance.At Independence, there were three perceived options for Indian nationhood. There was what has come to be called Nehruvian secularism, which opposed any connection between religion and nationhood . One reason the Congress has declined is that secularism is perceived as having no place for Hinduism. It can all too easily be portrayed as actively hostile to religion. The second option was Hindutva, which believes the Hindu religion and culture should be the primary element in shaping Indian nationalism. At Independence, there was a third way, the Gandhian way which gave a prominent role for Indic religions and, at the same time, promoted religious tolerance. The Gandhian option faded away, leaving the field open for the battle between Congress secularism and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Hindutva. Now, Arvind Sharma, a former IAS officer who has become a renowned scholar of comparative religion and is currently teaching at McGill University in Canada, has just published a book called Religious Tolerance: A History which adds a new element to this debate. His book is an attempt to explore the possibility that “religious tolerance could be placed on a firmer basis if grounds for it could also be found within the various religions themselves.”Evidence of tolerance can be found in all major religions as well as evidence of intolerance. A difference between Hinduism and the Abrahamic religions, Christianity, Islam and Judaism, is that Hindus have tended to give prominence to their tolerance, even taken pride in it.Sharma quotes Swami Vivekanand’s historic speech at the World’s Parliament of Religion in Chicago in which he said , “I am proud to belong to a religion which has taught the world both tolerance and universal acceptance. We believe not only in universal toleration but we accept all religions as true.”Sharma also has an answer to those who argue that it takes two hands to clap, that, in the Indian case, Hindu tolerance has to be met by tolerance from Islam and Christianity. For instance, he points out that it was Christian circles who first called for interreligious dialogue in modern times. Of Islam, he says, “...there is considerable evidence of tolerance in its long history.” There is considerable evidence of tolerance in Sufism which has played such an important role in the development of Islam in India.Why should a State want to have religious tolerance? Well, let one answer come from a source many might consider surprising , Swami Dayanda Saraswati, the founder of the Arya Samaj movement.He wrote, “The differences of learned people (of all religions) aggravate the differences among the common masses with the result that miseries increase and happiness is lost.”Another reason is that differences between religions drown out their voices when it should be heard. In his book on the climate crisis, writer Amitav Ghosh says, “If religious groupings around the world can join hands with popular movements they may well be able to provide the momentum that is needed for the world to move forward on drastically reducing emissions.” But, unfortunately, they don’t join hands with each otherWho is to promote religious tolerance? Sharma ‘s reading of history has led him to conclude that it is only a slight exaggeration to say “the state of religious tolerance is determined by the State.”So, he suggests it’s up to the State to adopt policies to promote religious tolerance drawing on the evidence of tolerance in the history and beliefs of all the religions in India.The views expressed are personal
On August 15, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a raft of measures to ensure that India can maintain the delicate balance between its development priorities and the need to keep its environment healthy. The priorities of the government, PM Modi said, included saving Gangetic dolphins and Asiatic lions along the lines of Project Tiger, making Ladakh carbon-neutral, reducing pollution in 100 cities, and prioritising renewable energy.PM Modi’s endorsement of the need for a healthy environment is significant because only a strong political push can nudge both the bureaucracy and citizens towards opting for a green path, make it a mainstream issue, raise awareness levels, and increase funding for it. An excellent example of what political support can do to a neglected issue is the Swachh Bharat Mission — the PM’s interest raised the programme’s profile; sanitation became a key national issue; and additional resources were allocated.But there are other issues which merit attention. The Modi government is embroiled in controversy over a critical piece of green policy (the Environmental Impact Assessment). It has been criticised for opening up pristine forest blocks for coal mining, since this could adversely affect forests, critical biodiversity and forest-dependent communities, and undermine efforts to mitigate the climate crisis. The government is also seen as not doing enough to strengthen institutions that safeguard the environment. And even though renewable energy has been the top agenda, coal continues to be the mainstay of India’s power mix (50%). The Covid-19 experience is a reminder that the country should aim for not just socio-economic recovery, but a green socio-economic recovery. The PM’s intent is correct. Translate it into action.
Jewellery designer Riddhima Kapoor Sahni’s husband, businessman Bharat Sahni, seems to be extremely excited about her 40th birthday. She turns a year older on Tuesday, and he is counting down to it on Instagram with priceless throwback photos.A day before Riddhima’s big day, Bharat shared a picture with her from what seems to be from one of their wedding functions. “Countdown to 40! #FabAtForty @riddhimakapoorsahniofficial,” he captioned it. She looks gorgeous in an orange lehenga, with mehendi on her hands, while he is seen dressed in a blue sherwani.Five days before Riddhima’s birthday, Bharat shared a family portrait from what looked like an early celebration hosted by her cousin, Nitasha Nanda. “Thank you Tashu. The foods never been better! #Countdown #to #Ridds #Birthday #Big40,” he wrote.The picture featured Riddhima, Bharat, their daughter Samara, Neetu Kapoor, Nitasha, Armaan Jain, Anissa Malhotra, Reema Jain, Randhir Kapoor and others.Riddhima met Bharat while studying in London. They got married in 2006, after four years of being together. They have a daughter named Samara.Despite being the daughter of actors Rishi Kapoor and Neetu, Riddhima was never inclined towards a career in films. Unlike her brother Ranbir Kapoor, she chose to stay away from the spotlight.In an interview with Hindustan Times in 2018, Riddhima had said that her family never pushed her to follow in their footsteps. “I was not interested. I am very old now, but even when I had the chance, I was always inclined towards my creative side, and fashion, jewellery, etc. My parents never pressurised me (to become an actor), they always supported what I wanted to do, be it getting into the fashion business, or getting married in Delhi despite being a Mumbai girl. I am fortunate that my husband too has been supportive,” she said, talking about why she did not become an actor.

Owners of over 8000 coaching centres across Uttar Pradesh have sought permission to open their centres from later this month on the lines of recent advisory by the central government, which allows partial opening of schools after September 21.Like private schools, these coaching centres have been hit hard by the restrictions imposed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Almost all of them have experienced a dip in enrollment and several have remained closed since lockdown was announced.“We have appealed to the state government to allow us to take classes for at least Class 9 and above on reduced batch strength. This will allow us to sustain ourselves,” said Hemendra Kushwaha, president of group of coaching centres.According to higher education department officials, more than 8000 coaching institutes are present across the state in which over 1.5 million students are enrolled. Majority of these students are of class 8 and above. In Lucknow, there are more than 700 centres.“We have written to chief minister Yogi Adityanath and several other cabinet ministers hoping for some relief. But we have not received any assurance as yet from any of them. The livelihood of many families depends on coaching centres which may be destroyed if the classes do not resume soon,” said Deepesh Singh, owner of a coaching centre in Lucknow.Though some coaching centres have started online classes but have received tepid response.“We have close to 600 students enrolled with us last year. This time we only have 120 students who attend online classes. Students and parents don’t see any benefit of taking coaching classes online and are very reluctant to join,” said Pramod Srivastav, owner of another coaching centre.The state government has not issued any directions regarding opening of coaching centres till date.
Actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s sister Shweta Singh Kirti on Monday shared a new song, dedicated to her late brother.

This song is dedicated to honor and celebrate his ever-felt presence in our lives. #Justice4SSRIsGlobalDemand.” The song has a video montage showing Sushant’s best moments. He can be seen running on a beach with a parachute behind him, running with his pet labrador, taking off on a flight, his fun moments with his sisters, shots of fans demanding justice for the actor holding marches with placards, his family moments with his father, late mother and Shweta. There are also shots of him modelling, billboards across cities around the world and many such happy moments from his life.The song has been sung by Neel Ghosh and Arpita Chakraborty, the music has been composed by Shubham Sundaram. Its lyrics are by Aditya Chakraborty.Shweta has been at the forefront of the family’s campaign to get justice for Sushant. Shweta has successfully run global prayer for the actor, run hashtags such as #FeedFood4SSR, #Flag4SSR and #Plants4SSR.She has been sharing throwbacks with her brother to keep his spirit alive. Sharing one such a memory from the time they were children, she had written: “We promised each other that we will protect each other forever. But,I failed Bhai...I failed! But here is another promise I and the whole country make to you, we will find the truth, we will get you justice!I knew my brother, the kind of person he was, full of life and joy. He was like a child, the only thing he wanted was love. Koi ek baar, pyaar se haath pher de uske sar pe, pyaar se baat karle, bas that was enough for him to make him happy. He was not a person who would take his own life. My heart is not ready to believe it. Let’s keep our intentions clear, we want to know what is the cause of Sushant’s death, nothing less will suffice! It is Satya ka Agrah, #SatyagrahForSSR.”Shweta has often come out in support of Ankita Lokhande and Kangana Ranaut, both of whom have come under attack for the passionate advocacy of the family’s claims in the death case.
It seems Kiara Advani’s feisty Indoo Ki Jawani will release on an OTT platform after all. With the theatres still closed during the coronavirus pandemic, the film will be out on September 16. Sharing the Indoo Ki Jawani teaser, Kiara wrote, “ Main toh time se aa jaungi, date ke liye aap late mat hona! Wait just a little more to meet Indoo! #IndooKiJawani.”The clip has Kiara as Indoo. Looking for some excitement, she says that she has fixed a date for herself on a dating app. She swipes right and the screen says ‘16th September, it’s a date’.Directed by Abir Sengupta, the film was supposed to release in theatres on June 5 but was postponed due to the pandemic. It stars Aditya Seal, who was last seen in Tiger Shroff-starrer Student of the Year 2.A coming of age comedy, the film is about the adventures of Indoo whose left and right swipes on a dating app result in hilarious chaos. The film started shooting earlier this year in Lucknow.“I’ve been prepping for the character ever since I signed the film. It’s finally time to live the character. Indoo is a part of every young Indian girl; she’s endearing, lovable and quirky. It’s going to be a cracking entertainer,” the actor had said previously.Given that Kiara’s character is from Ghaziabad, the actor worked extensively on her diction and pronunciation. She also did look tests to get the appearance right as well as the mannerisms and body language associated with girls from the city.
The draft National Education Policy (NEP) of 2019 made an unequivocal statement on the discontinuation of the unequal system of contract teachers/para-teachers at all levels, from primary right up to colleges and universities. It recognised the need to relieve teachers of non-educational duties, facilitate vibrant professional communities and give more autonomy in the classroom. It recognised that none of the ideas discussed in the draft policy would be possible without a road map to transform the way teachers are positioned in the system.And the first step towards restoring the status of teachers was to ensure that all of them had the same service conditions, regarding pay, in-service teacher-training, transfers and other benefits.Unfortunately, NEP 2020 does not make any unequivocal statement on discontinuing the practice of hiring contract teachers. It starts with a recognition that “the teacher must be at the centre of the fundamental reforms in the education system… (it) must re-establish teachers, at all levels, as the most respected and essential members of our society… (it) must help recruit the very best and brightest to enter the teaching profession at all levels, by ensuing respect, dignity, and autonomy…”. It recognises teachers “as the heart of the learning process”, and, thus, the need for “recruitment, continuous professional development, positive working environment and service conditions”. The words recruitment and service conditions are neither explained nor qualified — leaving it open to multiple interpretations.While discussing foundational literacy and numeracy as being a core objective of the new policy, NEP 2020 states: “Teacher vacancies will be filled at the earliest, in a timebound manner — especially in disadvantaged areas and areas with large pupil-to-teacher ratios or high rates of illiteracy. Special attention will be given to employing local teachers or those with familiarity with local languages… Teachers will be trained, encouraged and supported with continuous professional development — to impart foundational literacy and numeracy”.This is the uncomfortable part — what will the working conditions and salaries of local teachers be? Who will hire them? The schools or school complexes? Will they be paid a fraction of what regular teachers get and work on short-term contracts?After discussing foundational learning, holistic development of learners, experiential learning, flexible course choices, multilingualism, new ways of assessment and related ideas, the policy document discusses teachers in section 5 (page 56). This is where the policy marks a departure from the draft NEP of 2019.No one can disagree with the opening statement in Section 5 about the value of teachers or the need to end the practice of excessive teacher transfer, strengthen teacher eligibility tests, ensure adequate teachers across subjects, and promote local language and a technology-based teacher-recruitment regime.These ideas are indeed relevant and the fact that the policy talks of “overhauling the service environment and culture of schools ...to maximise the ability of teaches to do their jobs effectively, and to ensure that they are part of vibrant, caring, and inclusive community of teachers…” should be welcomed.But the policy is notable for its silence on equal service conditions for all teachers. The idea of locally-recruited teachers, without clarifying their service conditions, is worrisome.The practice of hiring contract teachers/para-teachers began in the mid-1990s without any policy-level approval in the 1986 policy. Why is this issue important? The total number of contract teachers was about 600,000 in 2017-18, according to the Unified District Information System for Education. Across India, in percentage terms, 12.7% of teachers are hired on contract today, with 13.8% being in the primary sector and 8.4% in secondary. States such as Jharkhand (57.05%), Mizoram (29%), Himachal Pradesh (28.16%), Delhi (25.28%), and West Bengal (21.48%) have more than 25% of the teacher workforce on contract.Across India, 79.1% of teachers on contract are working in “small schools” with an enrolment of 90 or less. As enrolment goes up, the presence of contract teachers decreases. In 2017-18, 68,445 schools functioned exclusively with contract teachers. During the lockdown, many states have not paid the contract teachers. We can only imagine the adverse impact on small schools and those that have only contract teachers.Teachers argue that hiring teachers on contract is a blow to the profession. They also point out that the dual system (different pay for equal work) goes against the spirit of the constitutional guarantee of equal pay for equal work. Evidence from several countries reveals that short-term contractual appointments have a negative effect on the motivation and social status of teachers. Contract teachers are typically posted in the most-disadvantaged or poor areas and poorly-resourced schools.Regular teachers get postings in well-connected, big schools. As a result, small schools have more contract teachers, many with basic qualifications and almost no in-service training opportunities.This unequal system needs to be set right by addressed by accepting the recommendation made in the 2019 draft NEP of discontinuing the practice of contractual appointment of school teachers and teachers in colleges and universities.Vimala Ramachandran is an educational researcher and retired professor of teacher management, National Institute of Educational Planning and AdministrationThe views expressed are personal
Former captain Ian Chappell believes playing cricket in COVID-19 era is a lot different from anything experienced in the past, but said the upcoming IPL can provide some “challenging” practice to Indian and Australian players ahead of their much-anticipated duel later this year.Indian players will fly directly to Australia after the IPL concludes on November 10 for the high-profile tour which is likely to begin with a T20 series followed by four Tests and ODIs. The IPL begins in Abu Dhabi on September 19.Chappell feels the high-profile T20 event might just be a blessing in disguise for the Indians and the Australians, with just a few series possible since mid-March because of the pandemic.”One thing is certain: where there’s a will, there’s a way, and the better players are dedicated to finding a solution,” Chappell wrote in a column for ESPNcricinfo.com..“In case of Indian players, and some of the Australians, they will at least have some challenging IPL cricket in the lead-up to the December series.”Chappell admitted the IPL “may not seem like ideal preparation for a tough Test series in Australia” but he recalled the thoughts of former England batsman Ravi Bopara in 2009.“After a stint in the IPL, Bopara was asked on return to England if this was appropriate preparation for a Test match. He responded by saying that ‘looking to score at every opportunity gets your feet moving positively’. He proved his point emphatically by scoring back-to-back centuries against West Indies.”The 76-year-old legend said with a host of health and safety protocols in place, it is difficult for visiting teams to prevail over home sides in the COVID-19 era.”With venue bubbles, isolation rules, social distancing, and a number of changes to playing conditions, adapting to international competition has been testing for players. It’s made life difficult and different even in a team environment but imagine the individual’s dilemma in enforced isolation with a tour looming,” he said.“The physical preparation is not so difficult, especially for self-starters, but how do you stay in cricket shape?”But the former captain said the Indians very well understand the stakes associated with the tour of Australia and will leave no stone unturned in their preparations for the series.“The Indian players could well adopt this attitude for a series in Australia that will impact the Border-Gavaskar trophy, the World Test Championship, and their personal pride.”It’s unlikely India will have the luxury of lead-up matches against tough opposition. More likely it will be intra-squad games, which can be helpful if selection is judicious and pits good bowlers against equally talented batsmen. The downside is the fast bowlers are often wary of injuring their own players,” he said.
According to an investigative report in The Wall Street Journal, Facebook in India has been complicit in enabling hate speech. Despite employees of the company repeatedly flagging posts by a set of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders and activists, which would fall within the social media publisher’s own definition of speech inciting violence and promoting enmity between communities, Facebook took no action. This was, according to the same news report, largely because the public policy head of the company argued that taking action would antagonise the government and the ruling party. By encouraging polarising and violent content, in an already fragile social context, Facebook choose political expediency and commercial gains at the cost of law and ethics.This newspaper has consistently argued that large digital media companies — particularly Facebook and WhatsApp (which is owned by Facebook) — not only threaten the current media ecosystem in India, but also pose a serious danger to Indian democracy. They provide a platform for fake news that has misled citizens and created information asymmetry; they turn a blind eye to hateful content, which has translated into violence, lynching and vigilantism; they create an uneven playing field which can affect democratic choices; they take money and promote targeted content which can skew voting behaviour and elections; and with their predatory commercial practices, they threaten other sources of genuine news and information. While some argue that these companies have deepened democracy and enabled more citizens to participate in everyday discourse, this does not hold true anymore, for Facebook’s practices have eroded the quality of democracy, not just in India, but elsewhere in the world too.And that is why the parliamentary standing committee on information technology, led by Shashi Tharoor, is right in taking up the issue and calling Facebook for an explanation. What is now needed is a clear regulatory and policy approach which treats Facebook as a media company. The current instance shows that it is not a neutral platform, as apologists claim, but a social media publisher which exercises editorial choices on content. And as a media company, Facebook must fulfill all the legal, regulatory, commercial, and ethical obligations that come with being a publisher. India has been increasingly alert to the dangers of Chinese technological companies for its national security. It is time to be alert to global digital behemoths which pose an equal danger to democracy, freedom and social peace — all under the guise of just being a platform.
Beloved author George RR Martin celebrates his 72nd birthday on Sunday and we are bringing back the fun story of his first meeting with Game of Thrones creators David Benioff and DB Weiss. In 2006, Martin met the two at the Palm in Los Angeles. His three books from A Song of Ice and Fire were already stellar hits and Hollywood’s top producers and filmmakers were all eyeing the series for adaptation. However, there is a really interesting reason why he chose to say yes to Benioff and Weiss.When the show ended after an eight-year run last year, George took to his blog to share his thoughts on the series, how it took off ground and how it ended. Speaking of his first meeting with the show’s creators, George wrote, “The last night, the last show. After eight epic seasons, HBO’s GAME OF THRONES series has come to an end. It is hard to believe it is over, if truth be told. The years have gone past in the blink of an eye. Can it really have been more than a decade since my manager Vince Gerardis set up a meeting at the Palm in LA, and I sat down for the first time with David Benioff and D.B. Weiss for a lunch that lasted well past dinner? I asked them if they knew who Jon Snow’s mother was. Fortunately, they did.”“I had no clue, that afternoon at the Palm, that I was about to embark on a journey that would change my life. I had optioned books and stories for television and film before. Some had even been made There was no way to know that this one was going to be different, that this pilot would not only be shot, but would go on to become the most successful show in the history of HBO, win a record number of Emmy Awards, become the most popular (and most pirated) show in the world, and transform a group of talented but largely unknown actors into major celebrities and stars. Even less did I imagine that I would somehow become a celebrity as well… and if truth be told, I’m still not sure how that happened,” George had added.Speaking about their meeting with George, DB Weiss had said they had already discussed the answer to the question among themselves. “He asked us who is Jon Snow’s mother. And we had discussed this before. And we gave an answer - a shocking answer, and George at that point didn’t actually say whether or not we were right or wrong. But the smile on his face - his smile was a tell and we knew we had passed the “Wonka” test at that point, I think,” he said.Benioff added, “Yeah, we had read thousands of pages and we got to a certain point - I remember I read through half of Storm of Swords and I called Dan (Weiss) and I said if somehow we get George to agree to do this and HBO to agree to do this, and we got to a third season and we get to this scene, which he (Weiss) had already read because he was a much faster reader than I am, I just think an audience is going to love it. But that means getting George to say yes and HBO to say yes and getting a pilot picked up and getting it - it all seemed pretty unlikely. And it all depended on this meeting and I would say we were intensely nervous. There had never been anything I had worked on before that I was so excited about the possibility of it. And it was pretty intimidating.”Almost 13 years after the meeting, Game of Thrones has made its mark as one of the most popular shows in the history of television. With path-breaking action sequences, memorable dialogues, more than a dozen iconic characters played by award-winning actors, Game of Thrones amassed a large fandom through the years.The end of the series may have been less than what was expected but the show still remains one of the best fantasy epics the world has witnessed. George is yet to release two more instalments in the series--The Winds of Winter and A Dream of Spring. George has been working on the books for a few years now and fans keep begging him to release the books soon. His latest self-appointed deadline for The Winds of Winter is 2021.George is also working on the show’s prequel series. Speaking about them, he had written last year in his blog, “Huge continents, ten thousand years of history, cities, deserts, oceans, mysteries, triumphs and tragedies. If there were indeed eight million stories in The Naked City in the 50s, surely there are eight billion stories to be told about Westeros, Essos, Sothoryos, and the lands beyond the Sunset Sea, south of Oz and north of Shangri-La.”“And in these days of a hundred networks, channels, and streaming services, I think television has plenty of room for two shows set in Westeros… or hell, maybe three or four… I still want to do ‘Spearcarriers’ after all,” he said. One of the prequels, starring Naomi Watts, was ditched by HBO. Another, set 300 years before the events of Game of Thrones, is still in works.

Have you ever felt more stupid than anyone else alive? (not counting Chaddha ji, of course). I recently did. At a social gathering, with social distancing, I found myself standing between two gentlemen who were behaving as if they are in a race to win some imaginary episode of ‘India’s most intellectual.’ They bragged ad nauseam about books, art, wine, cinema… and although each of these things I love and indulge liberally in, by the end of that discussion I felt like putting my fingers in the throat and choking myself.Read| A calmer you, by Sonal Kalra: Chalo beta, namaste karo!I’m sure you know about the malaise of name-dropping. But these guys were indulging in heavy duty ‘knowledge dropping’…and God, is that stressful to handle or what? You feel as if you deserve to die because you did not read The Great Gatsby by Fitzgerald while the whole world did and went into a collective orgasm, chanting ‘it’s a classic’. Let me tell you that it didn’t. Most people, including me, half way through hurled it as far as they could, because it seemed like the most boring book on planet Earth. I even harbour a secret theory that Fitzgerald himself could not finish writing the book because it was such a drag. But no one can tell because no one has managed to read it till the end. Anyhow, that topic is for another day.This week’s column is for all of you who get knots in the stomach when those around you flaunt knowledge about things that sound as familiar to you as the child protection laws in Sierra Leone. Don’t get me wrong here. I’m all for being informed about the finer things in life, because it helps you grow as a knowledgeable individual in the society. But then there are more books and films in this world than human beings, so it is possible that you may not know about some stuff that gets discussed in cocktail parties and book launches. And that’s okay. But in case for some reason you can’t or don’t want to admit that you don’t know what someone is talking about, the mantra is — bluff away to glory.Read| A Calmer You, by Sonal Kalra: You got just one life and it’s short, so spend it your waySee, I generally don’t advocate lying but if it’s your calmness at stake, let me give you three magic phrases you can use to get away from any tricky situation. And guess what, technically you won’t even be lying.‘It depends’: If someone asks what you think of Wendi Doniger being harassed by fanatics and you don’t know if she’s an author or a stand-up comic because you’ve woken up after a two year long coma — narrow your eyes, shrug your shoulders and say ‘It depends’. Before they ask you ‘on what?’ excuse yourself to get another drink.‘Not recently’: ‘Have you read Macbeth?’ asks someone at a party, and it reminds you more of Mc Donalds than William Shakespeare? Say, ‘of course’ with a smirk, as if he is a big fool to have even doubted. Then add, ‘but not recently’, so that he can’t follow it up with something that you are expected to remember.‘Quite a riot’: Confusing words that don’t really mean anything are a big blessing for those looking to excel in bluffing. This phrase, apart from sounding similar to the name of an American heavy metal band, also comes in handy when someone wants to know what you think of the wine in your glass, or for that matter, the art work on the wall. While people get busy wondering if you are trying to praise… or criticise, slip away.If all fails and you are stuck with a persistent moron out to call your bluff, try the time-tested trick that Old Farmer’s almanac suggests. Put some food into your mouth, point to your throat, start coughing and pretend as if it’s stuck in your throat. It will give you a reason to escape the room to fetch water, and all those who wanted to test your knowledge would have turned sympathetic when you get back. Try it. Never fails.Sonal Kalra has never tried any of the above tricks to bluff her way through a conversation. She’s genuinely seeing a doctor to know why she chokes on her food ever so often.
It was 1918, three years after he returned to India from South Africa. Mahatma Gandhi thought he had a mild case of dysentery while in Ahmedabad. Tempted by an offer of kheer made by Kasturba, he went on to be severely affected. “This was sufficient invitation to the angel of death,” he later wrote in Experiments with Truth . What Gandhi had was a gastric version of the infamous Spanish flu, a pandemic that devastated the world towards the end of the World War I, a gripping story told in Laura Spinney’s The Pale Rider.The state of the world seemed immutable only a year ago. The global braid of politics, economics, dominance and relationships were all knotted together in a way that seemed impossible to redo.In December 2019, all this changed. A spillover occurred. A virus, normally resident in bats infected a human, in Wuhan, China. Often, the story would have ended there. The human would recover and all would be well. This time, the virus had the ability to infect another human from its first human host and then others. If the 1918 flu pandemic spread like ripples in a pond, the SARS-Coronavirus-2 has spread Covid-19 like a stone-hopping across the pond of earth. Not only has the disease wreaked havoc on the health and livelihood of the most vulnerable, the consequential damage to the world’s economy and morale has been immense. Lives and families are in disarray. The stress and the effect on mental health are not to be underestimated.On Independence day, as we look back from January 30, when the first case was reported in India, to the present, we need to grasp three strings — acknowledge citizens with pride, grasp the way out of this pandemic, and take a new path — to create a new braid that will hold India and the world together in a more just way.To anyone unfamiliar with India, it would seem extraordinary how all of India observed lockdowns from the first one onwards. Next, our doctors, nurses and hospitals worked relentlessly. Our administrators from the smallest towns to the big metros have also not rested. Our scientists and engineers, our industry, our farmers, all came together to make extraordinary products for our people and the medical system, defying broken global supply chains.From within government at every level, and at every level in the bureaucracy, there was and is an unflinching commitment to deal with each aspect of this pandemic. These are extraordinary times where decisions, based on complex and multifarious inputs, have to be taken each day, accepted by all each day, and then implemented. All of this under the relentless, eagle-eyed, and critical watch of the media, of intellectuals, and of disease-analysts; all necessary and natural feedback in a democracy.Now, as we go two-thirds of the way through this nightmare year, it is more necessary than ever to wake up, take charge and wrest our lives and livelihood back, and not be numbed into inaction, waiting for a miracle to lead us out. In truth, that miracle is here and it is all of us. We have learnt much about the virus and we need to learn a lot more. But, some conclusions from science are very persuasive.External help is also at hand. Through the efforts of scientists, we are getting better and faster diagnostics tests. In the near future, we will have access to inexpensive and frequent tests, allowing us to carry on with our activities more efficiently than we could in the early stages of the pandemic. Drugs that mitigate the severity of the disease are available and more will come steadily. Drugs that prevent the disease are more difficult, but large efforts are underway. Increasingly, successful vaccines appear more and more promising. They will come and be rolled out, we expect. Studies are ongoing but it seems likely that those who have recovered will be immune to re-infection at least for a while. So, the time, if ever there was one, for shock and despondency is long over. We need to focus on innovative ways to recover and brighten the lives of every Indian.While behaviour, drugs and vaccines will give us an exit from the disease, we need to also pull ourselves up into a new route to recovery and prosperity. The fury of the pandemic has brought together our people and their expectations, our industry and its aspirations, our scientists and their purpose, and our governments (at the Centre and the states) at the helm. Analysts, over many years, have lamented the “silo” mentality in each of our structures and how, if only, we worked with a shared purpose, much can be done. We have worked together during the pandemic, because, now we must work together as that is the only future we have.Here, science and technology has a critical role and must take courage and place itself at the centre. For the first time in many, many years, people have demanded research, not just the fruits of research. There is an appreciation of and expectation from scientists of every kind.We, therefore have a responsibly of immense proportions. Speaking in 1941 on language and science, Albert Einstein said that if the goals of a society are clearly articulated, scientists will find the means to reach them. If there is “perfection of means and confusion of goals”— and much of our science has been trapped in this cage — will not move ahead. The pandemic has shaken us to what our goals should be — we must focus on the environment, biodiversity and sustainable development through Aatmavishwaas and Aatmanirbharata.Ill with flu in the 1918 pandemic, the Mahatma did not flinch and instilled both. On this Independence day, we must take that path again.K Vijay Raghavan is principal scientific adviser, Government of IndiaThe views expressed are personal

Movie theatres have been shut since the lockdown first came into force (around mid-March). As a result, the OTT space has spread it’s reach at a breakneck speed in India. And although theatre owners have incurred heavy losses, many feel the rise of OTT platforms is great news for content creators, at large. Nawazuddin Siddiqui, too, believes that streaming sites have “proved to be a blessing for smaller films.”“At the outset, I must admit that big screen has always had, and will forever have it’s own special charm. Wahaan ek alag hi mahaul hota hai,” says Siddiqui, adding: “OTT platforms, on the other hand, have a special, unique set of advantages. For instance, lockdown ke time mein bhi, kitne log meri films dekh paa rahein hain. Plus, the streaming sites are available worldwide to everyone.” During the lockdown, he has seen digital releases of his films such as Ghoomketu and Raat Akeli Hai.The Sacred Games actor also feels film theatres don’t lend itself to creating a level-playing field for everyone. “Theatres have become superstars’ personal fiefdom of sorts; it’s as if 5,000 screens pe unka raj kaabij ho chuka hai. But OTTs have come as a blessing for smaller films. With no investors, producers, backers or proper release strategy, chhoti films ke saath bahut sautela vyavhaar hota hai,” he says.Siddiqui further rues the lack of same set of opportunities for every filmmaker. “Aaj ki date mein theatres sirf paise-waalon ka ho gaya hai; unki monopoly ho gayi hai. OTT platforms, though, have brought in a democratic culture (vis-a-vis showcasing films). Now, our films also get picked up and showcased as prominently. Otherwise, chhoti filmon ka bahut bura hashr hota hai. Also, we are getting some fantastic talent — including great actors and directors — due to the OTT space,” he says.The Kick actor, who recently travelled to Dehradun from his village (Budhana in Uttar Pradesh) — during the ongoing lockdown — is happy to “spend quality time with his niece, nephews and brother”. “It depends on person-to-person. Mujhe koi shikaayat nahi hai about the lockdown. In fact, I look at it as a fortunate time wherein I am getting to watch great cinema, and also works of some fantastic actors,” says Siddiqui, who will next be seen in projects such as Bole Chudiyan, Roam Rome Mein and Serious Men among others.

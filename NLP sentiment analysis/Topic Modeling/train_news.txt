Updated: Sep 18, 2020 19:05 ISTThe Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation on Friday said it will restart its operations to Maharashtra from September 22.In a statement, the KSRTC said it had stopped operation of inter-state bus services due to coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and lockdown.“As lockdown has been relaxed, KSRTC will restart the operations to Maharashtra State from September 22,” the statement said.The services will be operated from Bengaluru, Davangere, Mangaluru and various other places of the state keeping in view the density of passengers, the statement added.The KSRTC said it is mandatory for the passengers to wear masks.It said passengers can book tickets in advance online at www.ksrtc.in or through KSRTC/Franchisee advance reservation counters for the above services.Even before the lockdown was effected, the KSRTC had stopped its AC bus services to various states and gradually suspended the inter-state bus movement due to coronavirus outbreak.
With India’s China Study Group (CSG) meeting on Friday, the stage has been set for a meeting of military commanders of the two countries in the coming week, to discuss disengagement and subsequent withdrawal of PLA troops from Ladakh.The outcome of the military commanders’ meeting will largely depend on PLA’s posture along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh and its deployment in occupied Aksai China.Consider the following :1. The PLA continues to build-up troops in occupied Aksai Chin and has started rotating troops on the LAC, indicating that it is preparing for a long haul on the border.ALSO WATCH | Ladakh: How Army, IAF are boosting troops, supplies amid China tension2. A disengagement and de-escalation have been discussed and agreed to at the levels of Special Representatives (July 5) and Foreign Ministers (September 10), but the PLA has made the restoration of status quo ante on LAC conditional, thus putting the entire exercise at jeopardy. Rather than withdraw in toto to base camps, the PLA wants to have a toehold on the territory on the north bank of Pangong Tso to show its stamp of authority. During discussions, the PLA has talked about withdrawing to the pre-April position of Finger 8 spur on the lake but wants to leave 50 troops at the present position, eight-kilometre up at finger 4. At certain places, it wants to place cameras to monitor Indian movements. Basically, it wants to earmark the territory for future negotiations. This has been rejected by the Indian side.3. Just as the PLA has reached its perceived LAC on the north bank of the lake, the Indian side has reached its perceived LAC on the south bank, thanks to courageous pre-emptive action by the Indian Army on August 29-30. The only option to restore peace and tranquillity is for both sides to return to their base camps and stop contesting on friction points all over the 1597 km LAC in Ladakh. While the Indian side is willing to do this, the PLA sees this as a loss of face for a rising global power and would rather create a new normal on the LAC.4. There is a serious element of distrust about China’s intent. The Indian army is convinced the PLA wants to stay-put on the encroached territory — a sort of reward for initiating aggression against India on the LAC in May. This is unacceptable to the Narendra Modi government.5. With the weather taking turn for the worse, both armies will go into survival mode this winter rather than initiating operations against each other. The wind chill is a killer in these areas with temperatures touching 25 below zero routinely at Pangong Tso and Chushul. High altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPO) and acute mountain sickness will turn killers this winter — not bullets.6. The Pakistan move to create a fifth province in disputed Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) in the occupied northern areas is being pushed by the Chinese through the Pakistan Army as Beijing wants security for the CPEC corridor, which it also wants to expand. This means that the Line of Control (LOC) between India and Pakistan will become the border, with GB being assimilated into the Islamic state. The main reason behind the GB move is to expand the CPEC corridor as China wants to create an alternative to the Malacca Straits sea-route by pushing hydrocarbon and mineral supplies from West Asia, Africa and Afghanistan through the new route. With India blocking all Pakistani proposals at the World Bank for infrastructure development in Occupied Kashmir and Northern Areas on the ground of the areas being disputed, usurping the Shia dominated GB by Sunni Pakistan will help in the expansion of CPEC, and also protect the already sunk Chinese investment in CPEC.7. The expansion of CPEC will also help China in controlling the restive populations of Buddhist Tibet and Muslim Xinjiang as the economic growth will feed into the militarization of both the autonomous regions. Already, China has started an expansion of its airbases in Tibet and Xinjiang by building underground pens for fighter aircraft as well as the deployment of top of the line missiles.8. The PLA aggression from Daulet Beg Oldi to Chumar in Ladakh is part of a two-pronged strategy designed to ensure the depth to highway number 219 from Lhasa to Kashgar as well as to push India to yield to the construction of a parallel highway through Karakoram Pass to rival the one running through the Khunjerab pass north of Siachen Glacier.9. It is because China has grand plans for CPEC, that it has no incentive in settling the boundary issue with India as this will permanently block Beijing’s ambitions in South Asia.10. With Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Myanmar now close allies, China’s next move could be to settle the border ostensibly in favour of Bhutan like it did with Yangon. Once the border is settled, it will open diplomatic ties with Thimphu and then, the kingdom may go the Nepal way. If this happens, India’s ring-fencing is complete.This may sound like a complete plan for China except for the fact that the Modi government will contest Beijing on each and every point.

For the first time in over two-decades-old fodder scam cases, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) took recourse of a new legal provision to oppose RJD chief Lalu Prasad bail plea even as it may bring troubles to several other convicts.According to the CBI, the court had never ordered that the sentences awarded to Prasad in four separate fodder scam cases would run concurrently. Hence, Section 427 (1) of the code of criminal procedure (CrPC) would apply and Prasad’s custody in subsequent cases would start only after the completion of the sentence in previous cases, the agency said.Section 427 (1) of the CrPC says, “When a person already undergoing a sentence of imprisonment is sentenced on a subsequent conviction to imprisonment... such imprisonment... shall commence at the expiration of the imprisonment to which he has been previously sentenced unless the Court directs that the subsequent sentence shall run concurrently with such previous sentence...”Former Bihar chief minister, Prasad, had suffered a major jolt in the fodder scam case on September 30, 2013, when a trial court in Ranchi held him guilty in the first of six cases against him. The conviction got him five years in prison, disqualification from Parliament and a ban on contesting elections. He was granted bail by the Supreme Court in December that year.His trouble renewed again after December 23, 2017, when he had been convicted and sentenced to 3.5 years, 5 years and 14 years of jail terms in three other fodder scam cases in quick succession. Since then, he has been in jail.Of these three cases, he had secured bail in one of them last year from Jharkhand high court on the ground that he had served half of the 3.5 years imprisonment awarded to him.“The CBI has already challenged the above HC’s order in Supreme Court and it is pending there,” said assistant solicitor general and CBI’s counsel Rajiv Sinha.In July this year, Prasad filed a bail application in the high court in the second case on similar ground that he had completed half of the 5 years jail term. But, the CBI, for the first time, took recourse of aforesaid Section 427 (1) of the CrPC to oppose his bail plea contending that Prasad’s custody, in this case, was yet to commence as he had not completed the full custody of previous cases.Prasad’s advocate Prabhat Kumar said, “The court, in last hearing on September 11, had not appreciated CBI’s argument saying that it was a premature stage to raise such contention. The court said the issue would be decided in the final hearing of pending appeal petitions.” He added that Prasad’s bail application would be heard next on October 9.Kumar explained that fodder scam cases involve nearly 200 accused and majority of them had been convicted in more than one cases. “Some of the accused suppliers were convicted in more than 25 cases and got different terms of imprisonment. If an individual’s total sentence is taken into account, it may be over 100 years,” he said.Advocate Indrajeet Sinha, practising in Jharkhand high court, said, “The appellant court has the power to order that sentences of different cases would run concurrently. I think this is a weak argument taken by the CBI in bail matters.”He added, “The appeal of fodder scam convicts are still pending in high court. If court goes by the mandate of Section 427 of the CrPC in bail matters, then accused, convicted in four or five cases, would have to serve half of the total sentences (27.5 years in case of Lalu Prasad) for his/her release on bail. But, it would be an injustice to him/her for keeping so long in jail in case the court, later on, acquits him/her after deciding the pending appeal petition.”Prasad’s current bail plea is related to the case of fraudulent withdrawal of Rs 33.13 crore during 1992-93 from Chaibasa treasury over fictitious spends on fodder and other expenses for cattle. He, along with 49 others, was convicted in this case. Prasad was sentenced to five years of jail term and was fined Rs one million.After spending the initial two months from - December 2017, to February 2018 - in Birsa Munda Central Jail in Ranchi, Prasad had developed health complications in March 2018 and was shifted to a hospital. Since then, he never returned to jail.
Anushka Shetty and R Madhavan-starrer Nishabdam may skip theatrical release and take the digital route. Producer Kona Venkat has dropped hints after he recently ran a poll in which he asked people their opinion about watching the film on an OTT platform.Kona Venkat wrote, “R u ready for NISHABDAM on OTT? (sic).” Over 70 percent of the people voted for watching the film on an OTT platform. Rumour has it that Nishabdam will premiere on Amazon Prime soon. An official announcement can be expected to be made this week.Directed by Hemant Madhukar, the film also stars Anjali, Shalini Pandey and Hollywood actor Michael Madsen in crucial roles.The first look poster of Anushka Shetty’s character from Nishabdam was unveiled in September last year. The poster introduces Anushka as Sakshi, a mute artist who expresses through her art. In the poster, Anushka is seen gazing at something and painting it on the drawing board in front of her. Anushka plays a deaf and mute character while Madhavan plays her husband in the film which revolves around the murder of a key character and the subsequent investigation to find the killer.The entire film has been shot in Seattle, USA. Originally shot in Tamil and Telugu, the makers also plan to release Nishabdam in English, Hindi, Malayalam and Kannada. The film has been titled Silence in English and Hindi.Last seen on screen in a cameo in Chiranjeevi’s Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy, Nishabdam will be Anushka’s major release since Bhaagamathie, which is all set to be remade in Hindi with Bhumi Pednekar as Durgavati.Anushka will soon join hands with filmmaker Gautham Vasudev Menon for a yet-untitled Tamil-Telugu bilingual. Rumoured to be a sequel to Vinnaithaandi Varuvaaya, the film might also star R Madhavan in a crucial role.
The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) has said it detained four people from Mumbai and Thane and seized drugs and cash worth Rs 4.36 lakh on Thursday as part of its ongoing probe into alleged drug angle to the Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death.The accused were detained after their names cropped up during interrogation of arrested accused Ankush Arenja alias Arneja, said NCB officials.“One suspect Rahil Arafat Vishra alias Sam has been detained in connection with alleged drug angle to Sushant Singh Rajput case while other three suspects Rohan Talwar, Nogthoung and Vishal Salve have been detained in separate cases of NDPS [Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances] Act,” said NCB’s deputy director, KPS Malhotra.“Based on Arenja’s statement that Rahil had supplied hashish to him, a team of NCB officials raided his residence in Versova on Thursday, and seized 928 grams of hashish and cash worth Rs 4.36 lakh.”Arenja’s questioning led NCB to Rohan Talwar. “Rohan Talwar is involved with Arenja, and raids were conducted at Talwar’s residence in Powai. We recovered 10 grams of marijuana,” said Malhotra.Talwar’s questioning led NCB to Nogthoung who was intercepted in Thane. NCB officials allegedly recovered 370 grams of marijuana from him. Nogthong revealed the name of another suspect Vishal Salve who was also intercepted in Thane and NCB allegedly found 110 grams of marijuana in his possession, said Malhotra.“We have detained Rahil, Rohan Talwar, Nogthong, and Vishal Salve, and are questioning them to get more information regarding drug syndicates in the city and also to find out who are the main supplier of drugs,” said Malhotra.NCB has till now arrested 18 accused in the case. They include Rajput’s girlfriend, Rhea Chakraborty, her brother Showik and his friend Suryadeep Malhotra.
The T20 game is unpredictable. But the 13th edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL), which begins on September 19, promises to be particularly unpredictable. Consider the unknowns. All IPL teams were assembled keeping home conditions in mind; for example, Kolkata Knight Riders is packed with fast bowlers and big- hitting batsmen who like taking on pace and bounce because of the nature of the Eden Gardens pitch. How will they cope with the low and slow pitches of the United Arab Emirates (UAE)? Data says that T20 scoring rates in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, two of the three venues for this season (the third is Sharjah), have lower scoring rates than any of the Indian venues, except Chennai.Data also suggests that it’s much harder to hit sixes on the UAE pitches than on Indian grounds — will this give someone like Virat Kohli, whose strength lies in anchoring an innings rather than exploding from the first ball, an ideal platform to excel? How will the pitches hold up to the sheer volume of matches? Each venue will host roughly a game every second day for two months.How will the players cope without crowds? Will it drop the intensity of their game, or help them focus better? And what about the fact that a majority of the players are coming off a very long layoff? What will it do to their fitness and their match endurance? Finally, there is, of course, the inglorious uncertainty of playing while a pandemic rages in the background, threatening to breach the sporting “bio-bubble” at the slightest slip-up.
As the Indian Premier League (IPL 2020) gets underway in Abu Dhabi on Saturday, one can’t help but say ‘Thank God’. With the pandemic playing havoc and good news hard to come by, IPL will be a much needed distraction, well, at least for die hard cricket fans. The beauty of IPL lies in its simplicity. On the face of it every match is like a ride in an amusement park, except a few damp squibs, which finishes fast and provides enormous excitement.IPL 2020 CSK vs MI Live UpdatesThe opener will pit defending champions Mumbai Indians against Chennai Super Kings, undoubtedly the ‘Clasico’ of the IPL. I might be accused of blasphemy by the purists but watching these two teams battle it out is quite akin to watching Al Pacino and Robert De Niro on screen together. There is intensity, mutual admiration and loads of talent on display.IPL 2020 MI vs CSK: When and where to watch Live on TV and Online?What makes this clash unique is the ‘battle of the best’ factor. With 7 titles and 13 final appearances between them, these two bring up the creme de la creme of the league. But unlike the past, when there has been little to choose between the two outfits, there seems to be a clear favourite this time.READ | What does it take to succeed in the IPL?Rohit Sharma’s team has got the better of Dhoni’s men in the last five meetings and it is not for nothing. CSK is an ageing band with their leads well past their sell by date. Hence, they succumb in front of a well oiled machine like the Mumbai Indians.But the likes of Dhoni, Bravo and Watson love to make journalists and naysayers - both are not to be clubbed together - eat their words. But the reality is these players will depend more on muscle memory than form and that is where lies the problem. Add to that the absence of Suresh Raina and Harbhajan Singh, both guaranteed starters, and CSK have a gaping hole in their arsenal. Mumbai Indians too are without Lasith Malinga but they still have Jasprit Bumrah to fall back on.Mumbai Indians’ batting is their stronger suit, with captain Rohit leading the pack. Quinton de Kock and Kieron Pollard add muscle, while the likes of Suryakumar Yadav and Ishan Kishan provide quality Indian talent. The Pandya brothers are the engine room of this unit and can deliver the goods with both bat and ball.CSK will rely heavily on the duo of Watson and Dhoni for the blitz. Faf du Plessis could well play the sheet anchor while Ambati Rayudu will have to step up in the absence of Raina. Bravo and Jadeja can provide extra cover with the bat but they can’t be asked to do the heavy lifting. Kedar Jadhav could spring a surprise or two, fitness permitting.READ | MSD is fresh, engaged and determined after break: CSK coach Fleming on eve of IPL openerThe yellow camp looks more in charge with the ball in hand. Imran Tahir and Jadeja are more than reliable with their spin while now recovered Deepak Chahar is expected to spearhead the pace attack with the wily Bravo providing an able support cast. Dhoni can also punt on Lungi Ngidi, who will increase the quality of CSK’s pace attack manifold.Mumbai’s bowling department will be led by Bumrah and he needs to be at his sharpest best. Rahul Chahar is an able tweaker and he will have to pick up wickets since Krunal Pandya is more in the space of a protector than an enforcer. Trent Boult has been added to the squad but Mumbai might opt for the other Kiwi, the tried and tested Mitchell McClenaghan, who has been a star for the franchise.It will be interesting to see how the Abu Dhabi pitch behaves, but if it is a belter where the ball comes on to the bat through the 40 overs, then the scales are tipped heavily in favour of the defending champions.
Just a few days after English U-19 captain Azeem Rafiq alleged that he faced racist abuses during his time at the Yorkshire club, former Pakistan pacer Rana Naved-ul-Hasan has echoed similar sentiments and said that he fully supports Azeem’s remarks.Speaking in an interview to ESPNCricinfo, Rana Naved said that he remained silent about the racist abuse from Yorkshire fans and the discrimination he faced at the club because he did not want to jeopardise his contract.“I fully support what Azeem said and this has been the case with me as well. I never spoke about it because, as foreigners, we were temporary and somehow I managed to accept the way it is. So I just focussed on playing cricket. I never wanted to jeopardise my contracts,” the 42-year-old said.“There was systematic taunting and it’s tough to do much about it. To us as overseas players from Asia, when you are not able to perform, the home crowd which should be supporting us, instead they started hooting and would taunt us with racist slurs like ‘Paki’.“If you are performing then you get all the space but, in case I am not taking wickets, the attitude suddenly started to change. They started to give us a tough time, giving me a smaller hotel room and there used to be a clear case of discrimination.“They would do some strange things to annoy us and make you feel lesser. It wasn’t abusive but their attitude wasn’t friendly towards Asians.“At time I used to feel bad, but I decided to ignore it because I knew I was not going to live there permanently. But I know what Azeem went through. He did share his frustration in my playing days. The way he was released by the club wasn’t ideal and says a lot about them, but I had been advising him to stay strong and take it as a challenge,” Naved added.
Japanese ruling party leader Yoshihide Suga was elected prime minister in a parliamentary vote Wednesday, becoming the country’s first new premier in nearly eight years.Suga’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party used its majority in the powerful lower house of parliament, which is empowered to pick the premier, to elect him to lead the world’s third largest economy as it tries to recover from the coronavirus pandemic. Following the vote, Suga is due to enter the Prime Minister’s Office as the new leader and name his cabinet later in the day.Suga’s appointment, two days after he was selected as LDP leader, brings the curtain down on outgoing Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s record run of almost eight consecutive years in the country’s top job. The 71-year-old Suga, who previously served as Abe’s right-hand man, has pledged to keep in place his former boss’s flexible fiscal stance and ultra-easy monetary policy known as “Abenomics.”Any sign of a departure from Abenomics could send the yen surging and stocks sliding, triggering a re-evaluation of the outlook for the nation. The Topix index briefly fell when Abe announced on Aug. 28 his intent to resign, but quickly steadied itself since then, with market players seeing Suga as embracing continuity.In contrast with Abe’s rarefied political pedigree, Suga hails from a rural area in northern Japan and took a job in a cardboard box factory when he first moved to Tokyo. He worked his way through university, before starting his political career as a secretary to a politician. He was first elected to parliament in 1996.Suga’s home of Akita prefecture, where his family farmed strawberries, is one of the areas most affected by the economic malaise born of Japan’s shrinking and aging population.While Suga has pledged to pick reformers for his cabinet, Kyodo News and other media reports say he has already decided to retain key players Finance Minister Taro Aso and Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi. LDP Secretary General Toshihiro Nikai, a veteran political broker, will also stay in place under the new administration, the party announced Tuesday.The role of chief cabinet secretary -- which Suga held for a record term -- will be given to Katsunobu Kato, a former Finance Ministry bureaucrat who most recently served as health minister, according to public broadcaster NHK.Abe’s younger brother, Nobuo Kishi, will become defense minister, NHK reported, while current Defense Minister Taro Kono will take over as minister for administrative reform.Speculation about an early general election has simmered following a surge in support for the cabinet. Suga has repeatedly said it would be difficult to hold a vote while the coronavirus outbreak is still spreading. The power to dissolve parliament for a general election lies with the prime minister, and none need be held for another year.Suga has been outspoken on some specific issues, including the need for more competition among mobile phone providers to reduce costs for households. He has said Japan has too many regional financial institutions, and he is a strong proponent of introducing casino resorts to bolster tourism.While Suga has little direct experience in diplomacy, he has said that Japan’s alliance with the U.S. will remain the cornerstone of its foreign policy and that he wants to maintain stable ties with China, his country’s biggest trading partner.Local media, including national public broadcaster NHK and Kyodo News, have compiled lists of the likely lineup that will be announced in the afternoon. Here’s who they say will be in the cabinet:(Updates with lower house vote on Suga.)
The 13th edition of Indian Premier League will start with a bang with long-time rivals Mumbai Indians taking on Chennai Super Kings in the opening encounter. Last year, it was Rohit Sharma-led MI that defeated MS Dhoni-led CSK by 1 run in the final to clinch the trophy. The yellow brigade will be eager to avenge the title loss and start the tournament on a positive note.Former India cricketer Gautam Gambhir, though, believes that it will be Mumbai Indians who may have the upper hand going into the first game against CSK. In the latest episode of Star Sports Cricket Connected chat show, Gambhir was asked about the latest chapter of CSK-MI rivalry.IPL 2020 Full Coverage“I am very excited to see how Trent Boult and Jasprit Bumrah will be bowling together with the new ball. Because Jasprit Bumrah and Trent Boult are world-class bowlers and both of them are wicket-taking options in T20 cricket. A left-arm seamer who brings the ball in for right-handers and Jasprit Bumrah who is unorthodox,” Gambhir said.“It will be a huge challenge for Chennai Super Kings as they don’t have Suresh Raina at No.3, plus Shane Watson does not play much international cricket and has not played cricket for a long time, so how he plays against Bumrah and Trent Boult. We will also have to see with whom he would be opening the batting,” he further opined.“I feel the Mumbai Indians have the upper hand if you see the balance and depth of the squad.” They have also added Trent Boult to their squad, who will give them a very good option,” Gambhir added.“Because you want a bowler who can give you wickets with the new ball so that you can use Jasprit Bumrah in a different manner. So I will want to watch how these two perform, not only in the first match, but in the entire tournament,” Gambhir said.Mumbai Indians will be looking to win their fifth IPL title when the tournament kicks off later this week. CSK, on the other hand, will be eager to forget about the pre-season and get things started on the right note in the tournament.
Joe Biden made his first trip to Florida as the Democratic presidential nominee on Tuesday with an urgent mission to boost support among Latinos who could decide the election in one of the nation’s fiercest battleground states.“More than any other time, the Hispanic community, Latino community holds in the palm of their hand the destiny of this country,” Biden said during a Hispanic Heritage Month kickoff event in Kissimmee. “You can decide the direction of this country.”A win for Biden in Florida would dramatically narrow Trump’s path to reelection. But in a state where elections are often decided by a percentage point, there are mounting concerns that Biden may be slipping, particularly with the state’s influential Latino voters.An NBC-Marist poll released last week found Latinos in the state about evenly divided between Biden and Trump. Democrat Hillary Clinton led Trump by a 59% to 36% margin among Latinos in the same poll in 2016 — and Trump won Florida by about 1 percentage point.To regain lost ground, Biden made the case Tuesday night that he would be a better president for Hispanics than Trump, touting his commitment to immigration reform and a new plan to support Puerto Rico’s economy.“Donald Trump has failed the Hispanic community time and time again, and that’s not a secret,” Biden said. “Whether it’s in his heinous act of separating children from their families at our border, or his repeated attacks on Dreamers, or his neglect of the people of Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, or his repeated failures to make sure essential workers have the personal protective equipment they need.”Still, Hispanic voters in Florida tend to be somewhat more Republican-leaning than Hispanic voters nationwide because of the state’s Cuban American population. Nationally, little public polling is available to measure the opinions of Latino voters this year and whether they differ from four years ago.But Democrats aren’t taking chances. Billionaire Mike Bloomberg has pledged to spend at least $100 million to defeat Trump in Florida.And by spending his day along the Interstate 4 corridor, Biden is devoting time to one of the most critical regions of the state. While Republicans typically post big numbers in the northern and southwestern parts of the state and Democrats are strong in coastal cities, campaigns typically battle it out for every vote in central Florida.Biden’s first event, in Tampa, focused on veterans and was aimed at pushing a potential opening with military voters, who broadly supported Trump in 2016 but are seen as potentially persuadable because of controversial remarks the president reportedly made mocking American war dead as “losers” and “suckers.” Trump has denied making the remarks, first reported through anonymous sources by The Atlantic, but many of the comments were later confirmed by The Associated Press.“Nowhere are his faults more glaring and more offensive, to me at least, than when it comes to his denigration of our service members, veterans, wounded warriors who have fallen,” Biden said. Speaking of his late son Beau, who served overseas as a Delaware Army National Guard member, Biden said, “He’s gone now, but he’s no sucker.”Biden spoke about his experience as vice president escorting military caskets home and working on military issues, and about his own commitments to strengthen the Department of Veterans Affairs and tackle the mental health crisis among veterans. And he attacked Trump for what he said were failed promises to veterans.“President Trump likes to say he passed VA Choice, but just like everything else he seems to say, it’s a figment of his imagination or a flat-out lie,” he said, referencing a program passed under the Obama administration that steers more patients to the private sector.Biden’s decision to celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month in Kissimmee reflects a focus on the state’s rapidly growing Puerto Rican community. Many Puerto Ricans relocated to Florida after Hurricane Maria devastated the island in 2017.The campaign announced a new plan Tuesday focused on boosting Puerto Rico’s economy and helping the island recover from Maria. Biden would create a federal working group focused on aiding Puerto Rico in rebuilding and would forgive disaster relief loans to Puerto Rican towns, expand a food stamp program to residents, invest in Puerto Rico’s power and schooling infrastructure and health care services, and help alleviate the territory’s massive debt load.Biden expressed support for Puerto Rican statehood on Tuesday night, though he said the decision should be left up to the U.S. territory’s residents.Puerto Ricans may be more open to Biden than Cuban Americans concentrated in Miami are. Many of them are attuned to Trump’s message that the Democratic ticket would embrace socialism.Indeed, surrogates for the Trump campaign focused on Cuban immigrants during a call with reporters. Florida Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nunez, a Republican, accused Biden of trying to “feign interest in the Hispanic community” after “neglecting us.”She said a Biden presidency would, among other things, appease and enrich Cuba’s leadership at the expense of the people. Some foreign policy analysts, however, say the Trump administration’s tough economic restrictions on Cuba only contribute to the oppression of the Cuban people.Biden, who hasn’t been to Florida since last October, has struggled with Latinos in part because of the record-setting number of deportations when President Barack Obama was in the White House. Biden has apologized for that policy.But unlike his Democratic rival Bernie Sanders, who used strong support among Latinos to notch key primary victories in Nevada and California, Biden has refused to adopt the most liberal positions in his party — especially when it comes to calling for decriminalizing illegal crossings of the U.S.-Mexico border and halting all deportations indefinitely. He supports a 100-day moratorium on deportations.As for Trump, despite many of his anti-immigration policies, some Latino voters have responded positively to the president’s embrace of religious conservative positions and his warnings of protest-related violence and socialism. Trump also frequently visits his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, and the president votes absentee in the state.As Biden campaigned in Florida, Sen. Kamala Harris made her first trip to her home state of California as his running mate. She toured wildfire damage in the small foothill community of Auberry, declaring that federal disaster aid is “not a partisan issue” in response to Trump’s threats to withhold aid from the state.
The Indian Army has observed Chinese medical teams evacuate a few soldiers of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) on stretchers from heights in the Finger Area on the northern bank of Pangong Tso to a nearby field hospital, officials familiar with the developments said on Friday, speaking on the condition of anonymity.Some Chinese troops have been evacuated from the Finger 4 heights to a field medical facility ahead of Finger 6 during the last two to three days due to health complications linked to high altitude, the officials said, with the development turning the spotlight on the challenges of high-altitude warfare.The Finger Area, a set of eight cliffs jutting out of the Sirijap range overlooking the Pangong lake, is among the friction points in the eastern Ladakh theatre, where both armies have deployed almost 100,000 soldiers and weaponry in their forward and depth areas. Indian soldiers are barely a few hundred metres from Chinese troops who are holding positions on the Finger 4 ridgeline.As a harsh winter draws closer in eastern Ladakh, where Indian and Chinese soldiers are holding towering heights and already exposed to sub-zero temperatures, both armies will face the challenge of ensuring that casualties related to high-altitude illnesses are kept at their lowest, the officials said.“Extreme weather at those heights of 16,000 to 17,000 feet is bound to create health complications for soldiers --- both Indian and Chinese. And the harsh winter is yet to set in. The conditions will only get worse in the coming weeks and months,” said one of the officials cited above.Indian soldiers occupying positions in the eastern Ladakh sector have undergone the necessary acclimatisation to be deployed at high altitudes and adequate forward medical facilities are available to cater for any emergency, said a second official.“Indian soldiers have held positions at even higher heights on the Siachen glacier. But high-altitude warfare comes with its own unique challenges,” the official said.Prepared for the long haul in the Ladakh theatre, India has made arrangements to provide logistics support, including medical facilities, to its soldiers deployed in forward areas -- more than 50,000 Indian troops are likely to remain stationed in the theatre through the winter months to deal any provocation by the Chinese forces.“It will be best for soldiers to lie low at those heights and avoid any unnecessary manoeuvres or activities that could trigger severe health complications. Troops from both sides will face the same set of challenges as far as weather goes,” said Lt General BK Chopra (retd), a former director general of armed forces medical services.Chopra said high-altitude cerebral oedema (Haco) and high-altitude pulmonary oedema (Hapo) are among the serious illnesses that soldiers can develop at those heights.Around 1,000 soldiers have died guarding Siachen since the army took control of the inhospitable glacier in April 1984, almost twice the number of lives lost in the Kargil war. Almost a fifth of the casualties were linked to enemy fire before the November 2003 ceasefire between India and Pakistan kicked in. The remaining deaths were because of nature’s fury, accidents and medical reasons.Advancements made in high-altitude medicine, better gear, best possible training, in-house innovations, and following proper drills have helped the Indian Army keep the casualty rates low in high-altitude areas, experts previously told HT.
The Trump administration declared Saturday that all UN sanctions against Iran have been restored, a move most of the rest of the world rejects as illegal and sets the stage for an ugly showdown at the world body ahead of its annual General Assembly.The administration said that its triggering of the “snapback” mechanism in the UN Security Council resolution that enshrined the 2015 Iran nuclear deal had taken effect at 8 p.m. Eastern Time. That is 30 days after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo notified the council that Iran was in “significant non-performance” with its obligations under the accord, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA.“The United States took this decisive action because, in addition to Iran’s failure to perform its JCPOA commitments, the Security Council failed to extend the UN arms embargo on Iran, which had been in place for 13 years,” Pompeo said in a statement released at precisely 8 p.m.“In accordance with our rights ... we initiated the snapback process to restore virtually all previously terminated UN sanctions, including the arms embargo,” he said. “The world will be safer as a result.”The White House plans to issue an executive order on Monday spelling out how the US will enforce the restored sanctions, and the State and Treasury departments are expected to outline how foreign individuals and businesses will be penalized for violations.“The United States expects all UN, member states to fully comply with their obligations to implement these measures,” Pompeo said. “If UN, member states fail to fulfill their obligations to implement these sanctions, the United States is prepared to use our domestic authorities to impose consequences for those failures and ensure that Iran does not reap the benefits of UN-prohibited activity.”But the US move faces stiff opposition from the other members of the Security Council who have vowed to ignore it. They say the US lost legal standing to invoke snapback when President Donald Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal in 2018 and reimposed American sanctions on Iran. The US argues it retains the right to do it as an original participant in the deal and a member of the council.Even before the US declaration, fellow Security Council members said the declaration had no legal force, calling into question the ability to enforce snapback. Snapback means that international sanctions eased or lifted by the nuclear deal are reimposed and must be enforced by UN member states, including hitting Iran with penalties for uranium enrichment to any level, ballistic missile activity and buying or selling conventional weapons.Those bans were either removed or set to expire under the terms of the deal in which Iran was granted billions of dollars in sanctions relief in return for curbs on its nuclear program.China and Russia have been particularly adamant in rejecting the US position, but US allies have not been shy either. In a letter sent Friday to the president of the Security Council, Britain, France and Germany — the three European participants who remain committed to the deal — said the US announcement “is incapable of having legal effect and so cannot bring in to effect the procedure.”“It flows from this that any decisions and actions which would be taken based on this procedure or on its possible outcome would also be incapable of having any legal effect,” they wrote. Thus, the three countries said, the sanctions relief provided by the nuclear deal will remain in place.US officials have talked tough about their intentions to ensure the sanctions are enforced, but it remains unclear how the administration will respond to being ignored, particularly by its European allies, which have pledged to keep the nuclear deal alive. A wholesale rejection of the US position could push the administration, which has already withdrawn from multiple UN agencies, organizations and treaties, further away from the international community.In the midst of a heated campaign for reelection, Trump plans to address Iran in a speech to the General Assembly’s annual high-level meeting on Tuesday. Officials say he will also touch on his brokering of agreements for Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain to normalize relations in part to solidify a regional bulwark against Iran.And, as he seeks to demonstrate statesmanlike credentials ahead of the election, Trump has injected another element of uncertainty into the mix by threatening to retaliate “1,000 times” harder against Iran if it attacks US personnel overseas.Iran earlier Saturday warned that it may still strike US interests to avenge the death of a top Iranian general in an American airstrike earlier this year. But the head of the country’s Revolutionary Guard Corps mocked a report that it was plotting to assassinate the US ambassador to South Africa, saying Iran’s response would target people directly or indirectly involved in the general’s death.Amid uncertainty over that, the other 14 members of the Security Council and all but about five of the UN‘s 195 member states say the US lost its legal standing to act on sanctions when Trump withdrew from the nuclear accord more than two years ago.Pompeo traveled to the United Nations on Aug. 20 to formally notify the Security Council that the US was triggering snapback because Iran is not complying with the nuclear deal. He dismissed suggestions that the administration was engaged in anything legally questionable or even controversial.He has said the snapback mechanism was the “one thing that the previous administration got right” in the nuclear deal that Trump has denounced as the worst deal ever negotiated. Yet, aside from Israel and the Gulf Arab states, almost no country in the world agrees with the US.Trump administration officials have been attacking the 2015 nuclear deal for years. They say it is fatally flawed because certain restrictions on Iran’s nuclear activity gradually expire and will allow the country to eventually develop atomic weapons.The immediate concern of the US has been the indefinite extension of the arms embargo that would otherwise expire on Oct. 18. The Security Council rejected a US effort to extend the embargo in a lopsided vote which saw the United States get support from only one country, the Dominican Republic.

The US has deployed additional troops and armored vehicles into eastern Syria after a number of clashes with Russian forces, including a recent vehicle collision that injured four American service members.Navy Capt. Bill Urban, spokesman for US Central Command, said the US has also sent in radar systems and increased fighter jet patrols over the region to better protect American and coalition forces.“The United States does not seek conflict with any other nation in Syria, but will defend Coalition forces if necessary,” said Urban.A senior US official said a half-dozen Bradley fighting vehicles and fewer than 100 additional troops were sent in to eastern Syria.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details of the military move, said the reinforcements are meant to be a clear signal to Russia to avoid any more unsafe and provocative actions against the US and its allies there.There have been a number of escalating incidents this year between US and Russian forces who patrol in eastern Syria.The most serious was last month, when officials said Russian vehicles sideswiped an light-armoured US military vehicle, injuring four Americans.A US official said at the time that two Russian helicopters also flew above the Americans, and one of the aircraft was within about 70 feet (20 meters) of the vehicle.The deployment of the armoured vehicles was first reported by NBC News.Russia, which backs the Syrian government, has long opposed American presence in the country. The Russian Defense Ministry blamed the US for the vehicle collision.The ministry said Russia had notified the US-led coalition about the Russian military police convoy’s route and said the U.S tried to block the Russian patrol.The four American service members injured in the crash received concussions. US troops are usually accompanied by members of the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces on the patrols, and they have stayed in the region to root out remaining Islamic State insurgents.The crash last month took place near Dayrick, in northeast Syria, where Russian troops should generally not be present. National Security Council spokesman John Ullyot said the US patrol left the area “to deescalate the situation.” While there have been several other recent incidents between the American and Russian troops in eastern Syria, officials have described the August crash as the most concerning.This is the second time that Bradleys have been sent into Syria. They were used last October in operations with US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces in missions to defeat the remnants of the Islamic State group and protect oil fields in that area.The Bradley units are from the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armoured Division, based at Fort Bliss, Texas.“The mechanised infantry assets will help ensure the force protection of coalition forces in an increasingly complex operating environment in northeast Syria,” said Col. Wayne Marotto, spokesman for the US-led coalition.“The Coalition forces remain steadfast in our commitment of ensuring the enduring defeat of Daesh.”

Former India opener and one of the most successful captains of the IPL, Gautam Gambhir has heaped praise on South African all-rounder Chris Morris and picked him as the player who can add balance to the RCB squad in IPL 2020, which starts form September 29. Gambhir feels Morris is the player who can add depth to the RCB unit in both batting and bowling.Also Follow | IPL 2020 Full Coverage“Chris Morris provides balance to the RCB squad, a quality all-rounder although he has not played much cricket. He can be a finisher as a batsman and can also give you 4 overs and bowl at the death,” Gambhir said in a Star Sports’ show.Also Read | Four IPL records MS Dhoni holds and might continue to do so at the end of this editionMorris had a standout couple of seasons with Delhi Capitals (formerly Daredevils) in 2017 and 2018 but was let go by the franchise after last season. Gambhir, the two-time IPL-winning former Kolkata Knight Riders captain didn’t sound too confident about the four overseas players that RCB might pick.Also Read | Adjusting to UAE heat biggest challenge, says RCB star AB de Villiers“They have Washington Sundar and Yuzvendra Chahal as well but it will have to be seen which 4 overseas players RCB picks in their XI,” Gambhir said.“I still feel that RCB look a little batting-heavy. But one thing that you will see a little different is that the bowlers will be happy because they will not have to play 7 matches at the Chinnaswamy Stadium. You will be playing in Dubai and Abu Dhabi which probably have bigger grounds, wickets are not as flat as Chinnaswamy. It is always difficult to judge the bowlers from Chinnaswamy’s point of view.“India’s smallest ground and the flattest wicket is in Chinnaswamy, so bowlers will be happier and you might see a better performance from bowlers like Umesh Yadav and Navdeep Saini.”
Expressing individuality is the idea behind creating music,” says Sadasivan KM Nambisan aka Sadu, who about 25 years back, made a big name for himself with the indie-pop act, The Aryans who are known for hits such as Yeh Hawa and Ankhon Mein Tera Hi Chehra. Perhaps that’s the reason which kept him away from singing in Bollywood as well.“I have always been against this concept of lip-sync. If you look at our music videos as well, which featured Shahid Kapoor and other actors, none of them ever did any lip sync to our songs. It was always us, on screen, singing the actual song. I don’t think its fair concept, that in all the films, you have this concept where an actor or the star in the film is lip syncing to a song which is sung by someone else,” he says.“It doesn’t help the singer or the musician at all. Every playback singer, be it in the current times or the previous generations, would have been 10 or 20 times bigger than what they are right now, if they weren’t playback singers, or some other actor didn’t lip sync to their songs,” he adds.However, it isn’t easy. He accepts it as well, and shares that he too had walked away from the industry. One of the biggest reasons behind his comeback was that he was not worried financially. “For me, when you are not worried about releasing a song from a money making point of view, is when you are truly free. I have a successful pharmaceutical business, so I am not worried financially, anymore” he says.“So,I get that it’s not easy. It is a very tricky situation, because unlike me, there are people who depend on that final cheque. You do need money to survive,” he adds.That’s where, Sadu says, non film music, particularly the indie space, helps a musician in stepping out of the shadows. “No longer, do you have to listen to a producer or someone else, about how to create a song,” he says adding that Internet has helped musicians in a big way to break the shackles. “One of the many reasons why the indie pop music industry declined was remixes. Because all the companies wanted that. There’s no creativity there, because you already know that 80 percent of the song is already a hit,” he says.“But, today because of the Internet, you don’t have to depend on big labels or music companies to release the kind of music you want to create. There are so many examples today, of musicians who have done that,” adds Sadu explaining that the Internet is another reason which motivated him to get back to music. “I release a song and it is on 800 different platforms! It’s a great feeling, because you know that you don’t really have to depend on anybody to say what you have to say,” he says.His philosophy of “expressing freely” is quite evident in his latest single, Ankh Se Door Na Ho. “It’s a ghazal penned by Ahmad Faraz. A lot of people had asked me to release a ghazal kind of a song, and so I decided to wok on this one. But I didn’t want it to sound like a ghazal. I had to give it contemporary touch to it, in the sense that, today’s sound is very different and extremely dynamic. That’s what everybody is listening to these days,” he says. “Kehne ko ghazal hai, kyuki you have to give a genre to everything these days. In reality, it is a very peppy melodious number,” he laughs and signs off.Interact with the author on Twitter/@sammysamarth
Another national lockdown in the UK is not being ruled out on Friday, as the number of new cases shows an ‘acceleration’ in recent days.The number of those hospitalised is doubling every eight days, after the pandemic appeared well in control in July and August.New curbs called ‘circuit break’ are expected to be announced next week, aimed at restaurants, pubs and other hospitality areas. They could be shut or asked to close early for some weeks. Parts of north England have been placed under new curbs.This week, the number of patients in mechanical ventilator beds has risen above 100 for the first time since July. After daily new cases fell below 100 in July and August, they rose above 2,000 from early September. Thursday saw 3,395 new cases.Facing intense pressure due to inability of many to get tests, health secretary Matt Hancock said in a BBC radio interview on Friday: “This is a big moment for the country. We are seeing an acceleration in the number of cases”.“And we are also seeing that the number of people hospitalised with coronavirus is doubling every eight days. We are now starting to see the effects in hospital”.Asked if he was considering a new national lockdown, he said: “I have learned over the last nine months not ever to rule anything out. However, it is not the proposal that’s on the table”, stressing that it is “critical” that people follow social distancing guidelines.“If we do all these things, we can avoid having to take serious further measures,” he added.Government medical and science advisers have reportedly recommended another national lockdown, but Prime Minister Boris Johnson is against the severe measure that could further affect the economy.There is growing concern about the new rise in cases in view of the onset of winter, when flu, cold and other seasonal ailments occupy the National Health Service.The diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus in such a context adds a new challenge to the beleaguered health system grappling with severe staff shortage and other issues.
The PCB has sought advice from the England & Wales Cricket Board (ECB) on creating a bio-secure environment for the forthcoming international series against Zimbabwe, starting next month. The Zimbabwe team is scheduled to reach Pakistan on October 20 after which the board is expected to schedule their T20 and ODI matches in Multan and Rawalpindi.“These two venues are under consideration since both will be hosting the National T20 Championship in a bio-secure environment because of COVID-19 restrictions,” a PCB source said.According to the source, the series against Zimbabwe is being taken very seriously by the PCB as it will create a parameter of organising international series at home against other countries in prevailing conditions due to COVID-19 pandemic.The PCB will also be hosting four remaining matches of the Pakistan Super League 5 in November in Lahore with the domestic season also in full swing from late September to February.The PCB is yet to decide on the itinerary for a series against South Africa which could either be held before the new PSL season or post that in late March, 2021.The PCB is also hopeful that New Zealand, Australia and England will play away series against them in the next 20 months as per their FTP plan.
Filming has resumed in Britain on the movie The Batman, Warner Bros said on Thursday, after a two-week shutdown caused by a member of the production - reported to be actor Robert Pattinson - who tested positive for the coronavirus.“Following a hiatus for COVID 19 quarantine precautions, filming has now resumed on The Batman in the UK,” a Warner Bros representative said in a statement.Pattinson, the star of the superhero movie, was widely reported to be the person who tested positive in early September. The movie studio never confirmed or denied this.The shutdown underscored the challenges that Hollywood is facing in getting back to work after months of pandemic-induced shutdowns, and the stringent safety measures they must now undertake.Filming of The Batman had resumed north of London only three days prior to the positive test after being shuttered in mid-March, along with dozens of other movies and TV shows around the world due to the coronavirus.It was not clear to what extent Pattinson, 34, best known for his breakout role in the vampire movie series Twilight, had suffered any COVID-19 symptoms.The Batman has about three months of material left to shoot, according to Hollywood trade outlets. Its release was pushed back earlier this year to October 2021 from June 2021.
To reach complete literacy in the state, the Uttarakhand government will soon start work on an action plan to find out where it lacks and what more needs to be done.Uttarakhand stood third with 87.6 % literacy rate last week as per a report based on the National Statistical Office.“We should also link this phase of Covid-19 with literacy campaign. For this, efforts should be made to prepare complete data again. We have to focus on arrangements like Each One Teach One. We all have to work together in this direction to make our state 100% literate,” said the chief minister.Read More| International Literacy Day 2020: Kerala most literate state in India, check rank-wise listMukul Kumar Sati, additional state project director, Samagra Sikhsha Abhiyan, said that initiatives like Room to Read, help of NGOs, regular review classes are being undertaken in the state to ensure complete literacy.“In 2001, right after the state was formed, the gender gap in literacy stood at 27%. By 2011, the gender gap came down to 17%, due to various efforts of the state education department to ensure that more students are enrolled in schools and the dropout rate is less. We have various initiatives of interactive education now to keep the children engaged and also make sure that they go back home and educate their family members also in some or the other manner,” said Sati.He added that starting initiatives like Room to Read with the help of NGOs in the state has helped change the attitude of students a lot.“When the students see a colourful library full of books, they are inclined towards reading from a young age. We have learnt from our students only that when they go back home with these books, their family members are also interested to know more. The students in some manner are becoming the agent of change and educating their family members also,” added the official.District magistrates in the state have also started initiatives like installing sanitary pad vending machines in schools to promote personal hygiene among girl students and encourage them to come to schools.Last month, Swati Bhadouriya, district magistrate of Chamoli district instructed officials to install the machines in schools which have a maximum number of female students.“There is no difference between boys and girls, the society will survive only when daughters are saved. This message needs to reach each and every village and it is important to make people aware on the balancing of the sex-ratio. Schools that have maximum number of girls in the district should be listed and sanitary pad vending machines should be installed in such schools, to encourage girls to come to school,” said the district magistrate.In January, while meeting all district magistrates as part of the IAS week, chief minister Rawat had said that all bureaucrats should set November 9, 2020, as the target for complete literacy in the state.“If every person decides that he will make an illiterate person literate, then the goal of complete literacy can be achieved. We should set the target of November 9, 2020 (state foundation day) for complete literacy in the state and work towards it in mission mode,” said Rawat. The state will complete 20 years of state’s formation on November 9 this year.
A “fired up” Joe Biden joined Senate Democrats for a conference call lunch Thursday, telling allies that he is taking nothing for granted in the race for the White House and the down-ballot effort to wrest the Senate’s majority control from Republicans.The 30-minute event was a homecoming of sorts for the former Delaware senator, now his party’s presidential nominee. Yet it took place at a grave moment, with the Covid-19 crisis and economic distress hanging over an election like no other. Biden fielded questions, particularly from senators facing re-election, about his strategy win back the chamber and defeat President Donald Trump.“You could tell he’s really fired up and he’s working hard and is going to be out there and be much as he possibly can,” said Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, who is seeking for a new term.Biden is on offense this week over the president’s handling of the coronavirus crisis. He planned to be near Scranton, Pennsylvania, his boyhood hometown, later Thursday for a CNN town hall, following Trump’s on ABC this week. The appearances have been considered tuneups before the three presidential debates; the first is Sept. 29.As Trump prepared for an evening rally in Wisconsin, Biden seized on the president openly contradicting the nation’s top health officials to claim a vaccine would be ready as early as next month, just before the Nov. 3 election.“Mark my words — if I’m president, I’ll always level with the American people, and I’ll always tell the truth,” Biden said in a statement.On the private call, Biden did not take on Trump directly, but outlined what’s at stake.“He just said, ‘You know what we’re up against. You know why this is so important,’” said Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., a party leader who organized the event.Biden’s message, said, Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., was clear: “They’re ready.”Biden’s campaign team has come under scrutiny in recent days over its outreach efforts, particularly for what some see as short shrift with Latino voters. At the same time, Democrats have mixed views over the party’s get-out-the-vote effort that largely bypasses traditional door knocking to avoid health risks during the pandemic, instead relying on virtual outreach. Vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris scheduled an event in Philadelphia on Thursday with Latino leaders and elected officials.West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin said he encouraged Biden to remind workers how much he has been on their side during his many years in government.“I’ve said Joe, people need to know that you recognize the dignity of the work, the people have built this country,” Manchin told reporters. “They need to know that you fought for their pensions, you fought for their health care... and you’re not gonna leave them behind.”Concerns run high among senators over Russian election interference, stalled funding to shore up state election systems and Trump’s attempts to starve the US Postal Service of needed money just as many Americans will be mailing in their ballots to avoid crowds at polling stations during the virus crisis.At first senators were told there would be no questions, Manchin said, but Biden intervened. “Truly the Joe Biden we know,” Manchin said.Biden told senators he is making a play for “every state.” On a conference call later with Colorado leaders, he said his campaign will focus on mobilizing people to vote early, especially in places where such ballots are counted quickly, to keep Trump from declaring an Election Night victory before all the results are in.Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., a Biden confidant, said the former vice president generally has been careful not to talk too explicitly about a new administration. There was no discussion of changes to the Senate’s 60-vote filibuster rule.“He must have said this three times, ‘I take nothing for granted,’” Coons told reporters afterward.Yet looking ahead, senators were eager to discuss a potential Biden White House — especially if Democrats control the Senate. Republicans have a narrow three-seat hold on the chamber, putting Democrats within reach of a flip.Biden’s longest-serving adviser, Ted Kaufman, who succeeded him in the Senate when he became vice president in 2009, is leading that process. Dana Remus, the campaign’s general counsel, and lawyer Bob Bauer, a White House counsel to President Barack Obama, also are playing key roles.Tops on any 2021 agenda would surely be a Covid-19 plan and economic rescue package. Whoever is president will also likely confront a battle over funding for the government, with Congress now compiling legislation to avert a shutdown for the coming months.Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York joined House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., at the Capitol as Democrats highlighted their proposed national Covid-19 strategy to test and trace caseloads to try to “crush” the pandemic crisis.The Democratic approach is outlined with $75 billion in the House-passed Heroes Act, which was a nonstarter in the Senate. Senate Republicans countered with $16 billion for testing in their bill as the two sides reached an impasse.
Toyota Motor Corp. said on Tuesday that it remains committed to the Indian market and its local unit announced an investment of more than ₹2,000 crore, just hours after a report cited a top company official as saying that the company will halt its expansion plans because of high taxes on cars.“The future of sustainable mobility is strong here in India and Toyota is proud to be part of this journey. We are investing 2000+ crore towards the electrification of vehicles,” Vikram Kirloskar, vice-chairman of Toyota Kirloskar Motors, the local unit of Toyota, said in a post on Twitter.This followed a Bloomberg report earlier in the day citing Shekar Viswanathan, vice-chairman of Toyota Kirloskar, that said the company won’t expand further in India due to high taxes, which makes it difficult for automakers to achieve economies of scale.“The message we are getting after we have come here and invested money, is that we don’t want you,” he said, according to the report. Toyota has two plants on the suburbs of Bengaluru, where it makes cars and utility vehicle models such as the Etios, Innova and Fortuner.Things changed rapidly during the day, with Toyota Kirloskar first expressing its commitment to India and later Kirloskar making public the investment plans.‘Stressing that India is an “integral part” of its global strategy, the Japanese auto giant in the statement said it expects the Indian government to take steps to support the auto industry through tax cuts.“Toyota Kirloskar Motor would like to state that we continue to be committed to the Indian market and our operations in the country is an integral part of our global strategy. We need to protect the jobs we have created and we will do everything possible to achieve this. Over our two decades of operations in India, we have worked tirelessly to build a strong, competitive local supplier ecosystem and develop strong, capable human resources. Our first step is to ensure full capacity utilisation of what we have created, and this will take time,” Toyota Kirloskar Motor said in the statement. “In the wake of the slowdown that has been exaggerated by the Covid-19 impact, the auto industry has been requesting the government for support to sustain industry through a viable tax structure. We remain confident that the government will do everything possible to support industry and employment,” Toyota Kirloskar said.Vikram Kirloskar’s tweet on the investment plans was in response to a tweet by Prakash Javadekar, Union minister of environment, forest and climate change, who termed the Bloomberg report as “incorrect” and said Toyota will invest more than ₹2,000 crore in India over the next 12 months.
Transition from TV to Bollywood is no mean feat as the TV actor tag is still considered a baggage. While many actors have expressed discontent against the biases they faced during film auditions, some have even revealed their experiences of not being allowed to audition for big ticket productions.“There is a barricade that dividing TV actors from film actors. I’ve been told during film auditions that they don’t want TV actors, that TV actors only know a certain kind of acting, etc. It also happens that sometimes our audition tapes don’t reach the producer or director because people at the casting level don’t find TV actors suitable,” says Ridhiema Tiwari, known for her TV show Ghulaam.The actor, who made her Bollywood debut with Begum Jaan (2017), fails to understand this medium based judgement.“Give me the opportunity before passing any judgement on my acting capabilities. In a recent audition for a web show I was asked several times if I’ve done any TV show in recent past as they don’t want someone who’ve been doing TV back-to-back,” she adds.Echoing similar views, Mohit Malhotra, shares that after giving a good audition, he didn’t bag the part when his TV background came to the fore.“I was told ‘oh you’ve done TV, you know you’re over exposed’ and another polite version was ‘you’re good but we’re looking for fresh faces’. I was like I’ve the experience and technical knowledge. On TV, we work on strict deadlines and even without any preparation we act on scripts that get changed at the last moment. Shouldn’t my experience and reach among audience valued?” says Malhotra, who made his film debut with Hacked alongside Hina Khan.Malhotra points out that actors such as Neena Gupta, Sushant Singh Rajput, Shah Rukh Khan, Pankaj Tripathi, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Vikrant Massey, among others, have worked in TV. “Look at their film career. What matters is talented and audience acceptance,” adds Malhotra, who was last seen in Naagin 5.Recalling her brush with biases, Devoleena Bhattacharjee shares, “Mujhe mazak mazak mein bola gaya tha humey na TV acting nahi chahiye. What is TV acting? I understand some shows are over dramatic but then that’s the intended format. There are shows that require subtle acting too,” she says adding such biases are “demotivating”.Bhattarcharjee reveals many of her industry colleagues have faced similar experiences. “If you didn’t want TV actors then do you not mention that in audition ad? I was once told they don’t consider TV actors because date is a problem given TV shoots are erratic. These are mere excuses. For a substantial role I can adjust my dates,” adds Bhattacharjee, presently shooting for her TV show Saath Nibhaana Saathiya 2.All set to make his presence felt in Bollywood with Laila Manju, Shashank Vyas too agrees on the existing discriminations. “Most TV shows follow a pattern and at times story and acting may mediocre. But that happen in films too. So this set notion isn’t correct. I’ve been told once ‘bahut tv wali acting ho raha hai thoda normal karo’ but then I was following the script,” says Vyas aka Jagya of popular TV show Balika Vadhu.However, Vyas, Malhotra and Hiten Tejwani feel a change in perspective seems to be happening, though slow. Malhotra says new age directors, who are ready to experiment, don’t harbour any preconceived notion.“Though things are becoming better now, but a lot is yet to be done. It’s true that TV actors are over exposed. But given TV’s wider reach and a relatability, it’s easier to form an audience connect,” says Tejwani, who was last seen in Kalank (2019) and has dabbled into TV, films and web.The Kutumb actor continues, “But not everyone have this mental blockage. There are filmmakers who’re only interested in your craft. Nothing can beat talent. Also, unlike earlier times, schedules for a film shooting are shorter and quicker. So, balancing your other work with film shoot is easier,” he concludes.Author tweets @Shreya_MJ
Jammu & Kashmir lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha on Saturday announced a Rs 1,350 cr economic package for the business sector and a 50% rebate on electricity and water bills for a year for all sectors in the Union territory.“I have met almost 35 delegations from various sectors... a committee was framed which was headed by my advisor KK Sharma. The committee submitted its report on time...on the recommendations of the committee, the package [has been announced]...” said Sinha. “This is a beginning and more things are in the offing.”Sinha’s announcement comes as businesses in the region are reeling under massive losses since August 2019 when a lockdown and communications blackout were imposed to prevent protests against the Centre’s move to divest Jammu & Kashmir of its special status and to split it into two Union territories. Mobile internet services continue to remain restricted in the region even as other restrictions have eased. Covid-19 and the lockdown imposed this summer to check its spread turned out to be a double whammy for the businesses. Restrictions on mobile internet have hurt e-commerce that has gained elsewhere in the world during the pandemic.Sinha said the package is apart from the Rs 1,400 crore announced for Jammu & Kashmir under the Aatma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (self-reliant India campaign). He said a separate package will be announced for transporters, taxi-drivers, autorickshaw drivers, houseboat and shikara owners who have faced problems. He added there will be stamp duty exemption till March 2021 for all borrowers. “From October 1, Jammu & Kashmir Bank will set up special desks for young people.”Sinha said the 50% rebate on electricity and water bills for a year is going to all sectors including common households, businessmen, industrial unit holders, farmers and others. “...for this, the government will be spending 105 crores. This has been done for all,” Sinha said. He added the Centre is also working on a new industrial policy for Jammu & Kashmir.Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industries president Sheikh Ashiq said Sinha has kept his promise and announced the package and that the business community appreciates the gesture. “We are going through the components of the package. If there will be any shortcoming, we will again meet [Sinha]. We are really thankful.”He cited Sinha’s promise for more help and said they are hopeful that these initiatives will be helpful for the business community.
England all-rounder David Willey has tested positive for COVID-19, the player announced on social media on Thursday.The 30-year-old Willey last played for England in the ODI series against Ireland last month.“Thank you for all the kind messages. My wife and I received positive Covid test results,” Willey tweeted. The Yorkshire player said he was “gutted to be missing the remaining (group) games” of the domestic T20 league Vitality Blast.“Even more devastated that having been in contact with the other three lads Sat morning (before we had symptoms) means they’re at risk and unavailable too,” he wrote.Get called back up to play for @englandcricketGet left out of @englandcricket squadLeave the England bubble to play for @YorkshireCCCPlay two games for @YorkshireCCCGet COVIDLie in bed watching @YorkshireCCC & @englandcricket loseThe rollercoaster continues — David Willey (@david_willey) September 16, 2020Yorkshire earlier announced that Willey, Tom Kohler-Cadmore, Josh Poysden and Matthew Fisher would miss their remaining Vitality Blast group games.“YCCC can confirm that Matthew Fisher, Tom Kohler-Cadmore, Josh Poysden and David Willey will be unavailable for the remaining Vitality Blast group matches after a positive COVID test was received,” it tweeted.The four players had been withdrawn from Yorkshire’s squad to play Lancashire on Monday. All of them have been advised to self-isolate for 14 days, as per COVID-19 guidelines.Willey has played 49 ODIs and 28 T20Is so far in his career. He played for Chennai Super Kings player in the 2018 IPL
The countdown for the first match of IPL 2020 between defending champions Mumbai Indians and last year’s runner-up Chennai Super Kings has begun. The two most successful teams of Indian Premier League will square off on September 19 in Abu Dhabi. Ahead of the big-ticket clash, former Australia fast bowler Brett Lee said he is predicting ‘big things’ for Mumbai Indians captain Rohit Sharma.Lee, who is currently in Mumbai as part of the IPL broadcasting team, was doing a Q&A session on Instagram when he was asked by a fan to name the ‘most dangerous batsmen in world till date’.The former Australia quick, who has played for Kings XI Punjab and Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL took Rohit Sharma’s name and said, “I’m predicting big things for Rohit Sharma this IPL.”“The most important thing for Rohit Sharma is firstly to score runs for Mumbai Indians. He has got to be a good leader but I think being a good leader is a combination of leading from the front in terms of scoring runs and hopefully the rest of the team will take care of itself.” Brett Lee had said on Star Sports show ‘Cricket Connected’.Also Read | IPL 2020: Ravindra Jadeja 73 runs away from being in a league of his ownRohit is the third highest run-scorer of IPL with 4898 runs in 188 matches at an average of 31.60. The dynamic right-hander has scored those runs at a strike rate of 130.82 and he has also hit 194 sixes – the second-most by an Indian – in the tournament.Rohit, who is also the most successful captain of IPL with four titles to his name, on Thursday confirmed that he will continue to open the batting for Mumbai Indians this season.“I think I opened the entire tournament last year and will continue to do that even in this year,” Rohit said responding to a question of Hindustan Times during a virtual press conference organised by the franchise.Also Read | Five records that Rohit Sharma holds for Mumbai IndiansIndia’s white-ball vice-captain also felt that correct reading of conditions would be crucial to his team’s fortunes.“The challenge for us will be to adapt to these conditions here which probably none of us are used to, because not a lot of cricketers from our group have played here,” Rohit said.“I think mentally it is about going out there and understanding what the pitch is doing, and based on that, you need to plan your game – whether it is your batting or bowling. So we have had a good chat around the group about that,” he elaborated.Interestingly, Delhi Capitals head coach and former Australia captain Ricky Ponting also referred Rohit as the most dangerous player of Mumbai Indians for this IPL.
Low-cost carrier SpiceJet on Tuesday reported a net loss of Rs 593 crore in the first quarter of FY21 against a profit of Rs 262 crore in the same quarter of previous year as flight operations remained suspended following the nationwide lockdown.Operating revenue was Rs 515 crore as against Rs 3,002 crore in the same period. For the same comparative period, operating expenses were Rs 1,303 crore as against Rs 2,887 crore.On an EBITDA basis, the loss was Rs 11 crore in Q1 FY21 as against a profit of Rs 748 crore in Q1 FY20. On an EBITDAR basis, the profit was Rs 13.5 crore as against a profit of Rs 812 crore for the same quarter last year.The airline said the present operating environment on account of COVID-19 though does not reflect the true comparison of the current results with those of corresponding quarter last year.“This is the worst-ever crisis to hit the aviation sector,” said Chairman and Managing Director Ajay Singh. “But I am pleased that SpiceJet continues to innovate and outperform the industry.”Flight operations were suspended for most parts of the quarter. Partial resumption of flights initially and the weak demand thereafter was a reminder of the significant problems that this pandemic has resulted in, he said.In terms of operational parameters, SpiceJet had the best passenger load factor among all airlines in the country during the quarter.The average domestic load factor for the quarter was 66.4 per cent and the airline maintained its market share of above 16 per cent despite the impact of COVID-19 thus demonstrating robust operating parameters.Till date, SpiceJet has operated over 800 charter and Vande Bharat flights to help repatriate more than 1.2 lakh stranded Indian citizens from countries such as the Philippines, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Netherlands, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, Lebanon, Bangladesh, Maldives and Sri Lanka.
Questions raised by opposition parties on the alleged lack of transparency in the PM CARES Fund, and a comment by minister of state for finance Anurag Thakur about the alleged lapses in the paperwork of the PM National Relief Fund created by then prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru in 1948, led to the first major disruption of Parliament’s pandemic-hit monsoon session, leading to at least four back-to-back adjournments on Friday.Amid protests and heated exchanges between members from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the opposition Congress, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla held meetings with both sides to come out with a compromise formula. “It is my responsibility to protect all the members, I would request Mr Anurag Thakur to say a few words on the objections raised by the other members, whatever I said was aimed to run the House effectively, if anyone’s sentiments got hurt, I personally apologise for it,” Birla said.During the introduction of the Taxation and Other Laws (Relaxation and Amendment of Certain Provisions) Bill in the Lower House quickly turned into a debate about the PM CARES Fund on Friday, as Congress floor leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury and former ministers Shashi Tharoor and Manish Tewari criticised the charitable trust while opposing the bill.The bill seeks to provide the same tax treatment to the PM CARES Fund — created for emergencies and disasters such as Covid-19 — as is available to the Prime Minister National Relief Fund (PMNRF).Adhir said when Nirmala Sitharaman started speaking, we heard her patiently. “We didn’t say anything unparliamentary. We didn’t even referred to the prime minister. How could he (Thakur) take these names?”Opposition parties have previously demanded that the government be more transparent about the PM CARES fund, a charitable trust set up to deal with emergencies such as that posed by Covid-19 pandemic.Thakur, who stood in support of the bill, said in response: “In 1948, the PM ordered like a king for the formation of the PMNRF. But the fund has not been registered so far... How did the fund get FCRA clearance? How did it become a trust without registration? How did you give exemptions under ATG? I want to ask you all these questions,” Thakur said as massive protests erupted.Chowdhury lashed out at Thakur. “There was no problem when [finance minister] Nirmala Sitharaman was speaking. But [the minister] came and spoiled the situation. When Nehru is no more, why is he trying to defame him?” he asked.Other MPs also stood up, and some left their seats to stand in the aisles, demanding an apology from Thakur.The Lok Sabha was adjourned and a meeting of floor leaders to resolve the disruption was called.Later, defence minister Rajnath Singh praised the Speaker for having resolved the differences.During the arguments after the bill was introduced, Congress leader Tharoor said: “This (the bill) would permit the Government to retrospectively validate its failure and extend the time limit indefinitely while disbursing compensation to states. That is an unconstitutional violation with government undertakings in the name of ‘Act of God’.”Trinamool Congress leader Saugata Ray demanded that the PM CARES Fund be abolished and all the money be transferred to the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund. “Whoever wants to be benefited from the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund, let them apply to the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund, and not to the newly formed entity called the PM CARES Fund,” he said.Defence minister Rajnath Singh, who was involved in the ending the logjam, described Anurag Thakur as a good speaker and young leader. “The minister has clarified and now the House should run properly,” he said.During the debate, Bharatiya Janata Party’s Jayant Sinha defended the bill saying, “Credit is the life blood of the economy and if during this time of Covid-19 pandemic emergency, our financial sector suffers and the life blood of our economy is not available, it will be very difficult for our economy to recover, for companies to get the credit that they deserve, for MSMEs to be able to get working capital loans and also for smaller entrepreneurs to be able to fund their activities and prosper.”
A key structural issue behind the slowdown, and now the contraction, in the Indian economy is the crisis-ridden financial sector. The challenge has only become bigger over the past decade. As pointed out by former chief economic adviser, Arvind Subramanian, what was initially a twin-balance sheet crisis — encompassing banks and infrastructure companies — became a four-balance sheet crisis, including non-banking financial companies and real estate firms. The pandemic’s shock has made matters worse. According to the report of the KV Kamath Committee, set up by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to look into the restructuring of loans after the Covid-19 shock, almost 70% of banking sector debt has been affected by the shock of the pandemic.In this backdrop, the Centre’s credit guarantee scheme for micro, small and medium enterprises and RBI’s moratorium on payment of existing loans were crucial relief measures. Both these measures, however, cannot go on forever. Banks will eventually need to recover their capital. The longer this takes, the larger will be their forgone income and accumulated losses. But if the economy does not recover soon — and most experts do not believe this is unlikely to happen — businesses might not be in a position to start paying back these loans if the moratorium is revoked immediately. A rush to invoke bankruptcy proceedings against defaulters could lead to destruction of firms and, therefore, productive capacity of the economy.This policy dilemma is currently playing out in the Supreme Court. The apex court has asked banks to not declare accounts as non-performing assets until a final order is passed. The court will resume hearing on the issue on September 28. The entire issue looks like a zero-sum game at the moment; either banks or debtors will emerge victorious. However, the larger economy will continue to suffer, irrespective of which party bears the burden right now. The only meaningful resolution is to expedite an economic recovery. This will rejuvenate revenue flow and facilitate timely payment of debts. This newspaper has consistently argued that a fiscal stimulus is essential to give a boost to the economy. At the same time, RBI and banks need to make sure that due diligence is exercised while separating genuine borrowers who hold promise in the future from those who will perish in keeping with the market’s logic of creative destruction. 4
Veteran actor and BJP MP Hema Malini feels that both Jaya Bachchan and Ravi Kishan did not want anyone to tarnish the reputation of the film industry. While she acknowledged that a ‘few people’ engaged in the use of drugs, she objected to the film industry being singled out and being portrayed as a ‘haven for drug addicts’.In her speech in the Parliament on Tuesday, Jaya objected to a few members of the film industry labelling it a ‘gutter’ and maligning it. She was referring to Kangana Ranaut’s recent comments that Bollywood was a ‘gutter’ and 99% people engaged in the use of drugs. She also took issue with Ravi Kishan’s comments about drug addiction in the industry.Hema told The Times of India that it was ‘unacceptable’ to single out and defame the film industry, as the menace of drug addiction was not restricted to Bollywood. However, she agreed with Ravi that it does exist in a ‘few people’ and that the industry must take steps to combat it.“I agree with what Ravi Kishan has said, that there are few people and especially, the youngsters who are indulging in drugs. We, as an industry, should come together and stop this menace from spreading in the film industry,” she said.Hema called the film industry ‘reputed’ and said, “There are such reputed people who work in the film industry, but some are trying to label it as a haven for drug addicts, which is not acceptable.” She also said that Jaya and Ravi had the same end goal, to preserve the reputation of the film industry. “In the end, the purpose of Ravi Kishan and Jayaji was to not allow people to tarnish the name of the film industry.”On Tuesday, Jaya said in her speech at the Rajya Sabha, “People in the entertainment industry are being flogged by social media. People who made their names in the industry have called it a gutter. I completely disagree. I hope that the government tells such people not to use this kind of language.”“Just because there are some people, you can’t tarnish the image of the entire industry. I am ashamed that yesterday one of our members in Lok Sabha, who is from the film industry, spoke against it. It is a shame,” she added, referring to Ravi’s comments about the film industry’s ‘drug addiction’ on Monday.Responding to Jaya’s speech, Ravi told ANI, “There is a conspiracy to finish our film industry by hollowing it out. As a responsible member of the film industry, it is not just my right but my duty to raise it in Parliament and Jaya ji should respect that. I am just a son of a priest who crawled his way up and has worked in 600 films.”“I expected Jaya ji to support what I said. Not everyone in the industry consumes drugs but those who do are part of a plan to finish the world’s largest film industry. When Jaya ji joined, the situation was not like this but now we need to protect the industry,” he added.
Haylo, good people. If you detected a hint of threat in the headline, let me explain that it is not. Just a hint, I mean. It is a full blown warning because I’ve had enough of you not realising that it is high time you chucked some stuff out of your life. Hey, those of you who immediately thought of spouses and/or in-laws, give me a high-five. Now, give your right cheek one, because we are not talking humans, yet.More than four years ago, I wrote in this column about people who just wouldn’t discard things and how a lot of homes look like museums — of trash — but then nothing seems to have changed. Meri sunte kahan ho aap log? Maybe if I change my name to something like Sushri Sushri Sonal and start charging you by thousands to tell you how to inhale-exhale air, will you take me seriously.Read| A Calmer You, by Sonal Kalra: Want my mobile number? No way!Yeh three rupees waali advice ki koi value nahi hai, by God. Anyway, our homes, workspaces, sometimes even vehicles, are full of clutter that’s not only taking away a lot of space but also keeping us from, well, inhaling-exhaling fresh air. Just take a good look around you. Is there anything you spot that’s been there forever without being of any use, but only because you were too lazy or stingy to throw it out. I’ll smack you if you’ll let your clever brain cook up a ‘nostalgia’ and ‘emotional attachment’ argument to cover up your inherent inertia. Because my mind tries to do the same, all the time. Why is my physics text book of ninth standard still lying somewhere on the shelf? Because, you see, my bestestest friend and I played tic-tac-toe on the back cover and got our first punishment together. Ugh. That best friend, who’s now friend number 3,654 on Facebook doesn’t even know if I still exist in this physical world. But the physics text book stays. THAT, is our problem. Mind hi blocked hai ji, kya karein.Read| A Calmer You, by Sonal Kalra: Here’s how you can permanently kill your sense of humourAnyway, I tried to apply mine and here are five categories of things I think should be discarded right now, in the larger interest of humanity, to reduce poverty, to cut corruption in the country, and make India a safe place for women to live in.1. Black Spaghetti: No matter how much you deny, each one of us has a janjaal of unused cables and chords lying around in the house. An old charger of the 20 kg heavy Motorola phone that was the pride of your life in 1992, maybe the phone/pager itself that never got an antim sanskar, 265 pairs of earphones that you flicked each time you boarded a Kingfisher flight — when they were still Kings of good times, that is. Some cables that came with your TV video game on your 5th birthday, and are still around in the hope of seeing your 50th. C’mon yaar. THROW. And puhleez, read up on e-waste and dispose them off properly.2. Clothes that don’t fit: Our favourite hoarding candidate, this one. The wardrobe is screaming that it can’t take it anymore, but we’ll keep stuffing it with more clothes everytime the wretched ‘50% off’ beckons. But we still won’t give away the dress we bought at 50% discount 10 years ago and which didn’t fit us even at that time. ‘Someday I’ll lose weight and fit into this,’ Yeah? Aao thappad khao. Saale Sale junkies, all of us. (That’s a typo in the first word... I didn’t mean the extra ‘a’ but the back button on the keyboard isn’t working!). Golden rule: Deny yourself a new dress till you take out an old one.3. Show-pieces: In the last century when I was a kid, every house used to have a ‘showcase’, in which people placed all kinds of weird, I mean cute, things. Terracotta swans with necks entwined, photo frames of all sizes, shapes, material with pictures of relatives in all shapes, sizes and material. Plastic flowers in plastic vases. Now, I have nothing against these, seriously. Because the whole point of being the Lord of your house is to be able to do it up the way you like. But the problem is that we keep adding ‘show-pieces’ without knowing what to do with the old. Even when the showcases have all but gone in last decade’s renovation. The same goes for old toys, especially stuffed teddy bears that may be full of mere desh ki mitti from 1979, but we won’t let them go because well, there are emotions involved. Do the same emotions not tell you then to donate clothes, toys or books in good condition to some kid who may value them more? Think.4. Casettes/CDs that don’t run: Another big nostalgia candidate. Okay fine, kuchh toh rakh lo... because even I have a big emotional attachment with my old music cassettes, CDs and MP3 players/iPods. But when that attachment translates to shelves full of old CDs which have died of scratches, or cassettes which didn’t run even when we had the player till the time you wound up the whole magnetic tape with your finger, then you’ve got a problem. Thanks to technology, your favourite music is now safe, and accessible anytime, with Internet baba. Keep your attachment with the music, not the medium. Make space in your room, in your life.5. Medicines you no longer use: The other day in my medicine box, I discovered a strip of antibiotic tablets that had expired two years ago. I deserve to have expired with it. For being so scatty with things. We all are. We buy new medicines each time we fall sick, but keep retaining the old, unused ones, expired or not. The same goes for the tube of painkiller ointment which will itself writhe in pain if you’ll try to extract anything further out of it. Or the face cream that gave you allergy the very first time you used it. Here’s a request - please donate unused, unexpired medicines. There are people dying in our country for want of basic medicines. It just feels inhuman to be hoarding them. Don’t you think?Sonal Kalra has decided to throw away five things everyday.

Updated: Sep 17, 2020 16:58 ISTKaranvir Bohra and Shruti Seth, who starred in the popular show Shararat, recently had a reunion. Karanvir took to Instagram to share a picture with Shruti, in which their masks were pulled down and they had their backs to each other. While he seemed to be holding a to-go cup of coffee, she was seen holding a tender coconut with a straw in it.“Hum tumse mile, phir juda ho gaye (We met and were then separated)! @shru2kill. Maintaining the distance,” Karanvir captioned his post. Shruti commented on the post, reminiscing about their characters on the show, and said that they could never be separated. “Jiya aur Dhruv kabhi judaa nahi ho sakte. Kabhi nahi (Jiya and Dhruv can never be separated. Never).”Their co-star Simple Kaul, who played Parminder aka Pam on Shararat, showered love on the picture. “Cute cute cute. Love u both shruuuuu @shru2kill & manojeeeeeee @karanvirbohra,” she wrote.Fans of Shararat were excited to see Karanvir and Shruti together. “U ppl made our childhood awesome by doing some shaaaraaaaaaaarat,” one wrote. “I Love you guys so much!! Shararat Forever,” another wrote. “My God my childhood in one picture,” a third wrote.Shararat featured Shruti as Jiya, a girl with magical powers born in a family of fairies. However, as a novice, her spells often went awry. Karanvir played her college friend and love interest, Dhruv. The show, which aired from 2003 to 2006, also starred Farida Jalal, Mahesh Thakur, Harsh Vashisht, Shoma Anand and Addite Shirwaikar in pivotal roles.Meanwhile, Karanvir and his wife Teejay Sidhu are expecting their third child. The couple already has four-year-old twin daughters Bella and Vienna.Sharing the happy news on Instagram, Karanvir had written, “Ultimately, it’s God who is the creator, He crafts every little detail with His own hands. We are the vessels, waiting to receive whatever he has in store for us. Thank you to our Divine for this beautiful blessing. We are beyond grateful that He has chosen us to become parents again. So much love for the little soul already. Best birthday gift ever.”
A parliamentary panel has recommended abolishing tax on long-term capital gains (LTCG) for investments in startups that are made through collective investment vehicles (CIVs) such as angel funds, alternate investment funds (AIFs) and limited liability partnerships (LLPs) engaged in the business of making investments.“At a minimum, this should be done for at least the next two years to encourage investments during the pandemic period,” the panel said in its report, ‘Financing the Startup Ecosystem’. Jayant Sinha, the chairperson of the standing committee on finance, submitted the report to the Speaker last week.After the two-year period, the Securities Transaction Tax (STT) could be applied to CIVs to maintain revenue neutrality. “Investments by CIVs are transparently done and have to be done at fair market value. Thus it is easy to calculate the STT associated with these investments. This can be done in lieu of imposing LTCG on these CIVs and to make the taxation system fairer, less cumbersome, and transparent,” it said.Also Read: After saying no, Toyota says yes to expansion plan in India“This will also ensure that investments in unlisted securities are on par with investments in listed securities,” it added.Smita Goel, partner at law firm Algo Legal said, LTCG was abolished and STT was introduced in FY 2005. LTCG was re-introduced on listed equity shares and equity mutual fund units in FY 2019. This resulted in double taxation.“Abolition of LTCG tax will remove this double taxation and enable investors to choose investments based on risk and return instead of being driven by tax considerations. The loss of revenue from abolition of LTCG will be minuscule compared to the benefits generated as it will incentivise taxpayers to kick-start investment and also create jobs,” she said.Kunal Bahl, CEO and co-founder of Snapdeal tweeted, “These reforms would open the floodgates of domestic capital going into start-ups like never before, as long as the eligibility criteria of the tax benefits is not too narrow, enabling the widest set of startup investors and companies to benefit for a long enough period of time.”Also Read: Odisha to amend GST Act to make fraud in input tax credit non-bailableWhile re-introducing the LTCG tax, then finance minister Arun Jaitley had said in his budget speech on February 2018, “The return on investment in equity is already quite attractive even without tax exemption. There is therefore a strong case for bringing long term capital gains from listed equities in the tax net.”Giving the rationale to re-introduce the tax, he said that the equity market had become buoyant with the reforms introduced by the government and incentives. “The total amount of exempted capital gains from listed shares and units is around Rs 3,67,000 crores as per returns filed for AY 17-18. Major part of this gain is accrued to corporates and LLPs. This has also created a bias against manufacturing, leading to more business surpluses being invested in financial assets,” he had said.Indian Venture Capital and Private Equity Association (IVCA) regulatory affairs committee co-chair and founding partner of 3one4 Capital Siddarth Pai said: “The proposed recommendations, if implemented, will help increase the amount of rupee capital that will flow into Indian startups.”“Due to the distorted tax structure between startups and listed companies (with the long term capital gains rate on startups being 2.54 times the rate on listed companies), rupee capital is less than 10% of the total capital being raised by Indian startups. Tax has emerged as one of the almost singular reason for the same,” he said.The ability to raise capital during such trying times will be crucial to the longevity of India’s startup ecosystem and help it become more resilient, he added.Pai said the Indian government has applied the “super rich surcharge” of 25%-37% on the sale of unlisted securities, not on listed securities. “This distortion has pushed rupee capital onto the stock markets, where secondary transactions occur, as opposed to primary investments into other asset classes like startups. Investments into startups always go towards new product creation and new business lines—leading to job growth and economic growth,” he said.In addition to this, the lack of this surcharge on foreign investors and applying it only on domestic investors is further suppressing rupee capital into the Indian startup ecosystem, he said. “Under the honourable PM’s call of becoming self-reliant, demonstrating an ability to be funded from local sources ... will help boost the resilience of the Indian startup ecosystem,” he said.“India is at risk of becoming a land of subsidiaries instead of a land of startups as many entrepreneurs seek to set up their HQs [headquarters] in other jurisdictions in order to enter the Indian market,” he said.Pai said that the parliamentary panel has looked at allowing other kinds of investors to put money in startups such as pension funds and insurance companies. “IVCA has made several recommendations on the need to unleash domestic institutional capital which cannot invest in Indian VC Funds and startups due to policy restrictions,” he said.“Several Indian VC Funds and startups have received funds from global pension funds, banks, insurance companies and the like. VC and PE Funds are a less volatile asset class as compared to listed markets and these help in asset diversification and the return timelines mandated for such long-term investors. Its heartful to see that the panel has spoken to the regulators and such institutions to find ways to increase their participation in startups and funds, thus enabling the creation of a vibrant Indian startup ecosystem,” he added.
The government on Monday sought Parliament’s approval for infusing Rs 20,000 crore in public sector banks in the current financial year to meet regulatory requirements.This is part of the first batch of Supplementary Demands for Grants for 2020-21 moved by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the Lok Sabha.In all, the government has sought Parliament’s nod for additional spending of Rs 2.35 lakh crore, which includes a cash outgo of Rs 1.66 lakh crore, primarily to meet expenses for combating the Covid-19 pandemic.“For meeting expenditure towards recapitalisation of Public Sector Banks through issue of Government Securities” the government has asked for Parliament’s authorisation of Rs 20,000 crore, as per a document.In 2019-20, the government proposed to make Rs 70,000 crore capital infusion into the Public Sector Banks (PSBs) to boost credit for a strong impetus to the economy.However, the government refrained from committing any capital in the Budget 2020-21 for the PSBs, hoping that the lenders will raise funds from the market depending on the requirements In the last financial year, Punjab National Bank got Rs 16,091 crore, Union Bank of India received Rs 11,768 crore while Canara Bank and Indian Bank got Rs 6,571 crore and Rs 2,534 crore, respectively.Allahabad Bank received Rs 2,153 crore, United Bank of India got 1,666 crore and Andhra Bank received Rs 200 crore. These three lenders have been merged with various PSBs.Besides, Bank of Baroda got a capital infusion of Rs 7,000 crore, Indian Overseas Bank received Rs 4,360 crore and UCO Bank got Rs 2,142 crore. Punjab & Sind Bank received Rs 787 crore and Central Bank of India got Rs 3,353 crore.In addition, LIC-controlled IDBI Bank received additional capital of Rs 4,557 crore through the supplementary demands for grants.The government has also sought Rs 1,232 crore as subsidy to Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) on interest subvention of 2 per cent on prompt repayment of Shishu Loans extended under Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY).Further, Sitharaman has sought approval of Parliament of Rs 4,000 crore for meeting an additional expenditure towards Grants-in-Aid General to National Credit Guarantee Trustee Company Limited (NCGTC) for the Guarantee Emergency Credit Line (GECL) facility to eligible MSME borrowers.
The death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Friday gives President Donald Trump an opportunity to try to fill her seat -- and potentially cement a rightward tilt of the Supreme Court for a generation -- less than two months before Election Day.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has previously said the Senate would act to fill a vacancy if one occurred this year, even though he spent most of 2016 denying a confirmation hearing to President Barack Obama’s pick to fill a vacancy on the high court.McConnell would need to find 50 senators willing to back a pick put forward by Trump. With 53 Republicans, they can afford to lose 3 senators and still confirm a pick with Vice President Mike Pence casting a tie-breaking vote.“We would fill it,” McConnell told Fox News in February. McConnell said then that the difference between 2016 was that the Senate and the White House were held by different parties.Trump had not yet been informed of Ginsburg’s death, but Vice President Mike Pence was, according to people familiar with the situatoinOn Friday night, Democrats quickly demanded that any move to replace Ginsburg be left for the next president.“The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a tweet.Days before she died, Ginsburg dictated a statement to her granddaughter, NPR reported, saying, “My most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed.”McConnell’s office hasn’t responded to questions about whether he will act before the election, but members of his leadership team, including Senator John Cornyn of Texas, have said they expect he would try to confirm someone before the elections if there is a vacancy.Trump released a new list of potential appointees earlier this month -- revisiting a tactic he used in 2016 to galvanize support among conservatives and evangelicals. “Apart from matters of war and peace, the nomination of a Supreme Court justice is the most important decision an American president can make,” Trump told reporters on Sept. 9.In 2016, McConnell blocked Obama from having a hearing on his nominee in 2016 -- Merrick Garland -- setting the stage for Trump to install Neil Gorsuch instead.Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said at a debate last year that he was opposed to adding additional justices to the court if Democrats were to win the presidency.“I would not get into court packing. We had three justices. Next time around, we lose control, they add three justices. We begin to lose any credibility the court has at all,” he said. But, if Republicans move to replace Ginsburg this year and Biden wins in November, he’d face strong pressure from the left to expand the court.Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, issued a statement that was silent on the question of whether Ginsburg should be replaced before Election Day. He called her “a trailblazer who possessed tremendous passion for her causes.”“While I had many differences with her on legal philosophy, I appreciate her service to our nation,” said Graham, who is up for re-election this fall in an increasingly tight race.
Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank on Wednesday invited President Ram Nath Kovind for a virtual program on ‘Implementation of National Education Policy (NEP)’ to be held on September 19.“Paid courtesy visit to His Excellency President Ram Nath Kovind Ji and thanked him for his guidance in the ‘Governor’s Conference’ and ‘National Teacher Award 2020’,” Nishank tweeted.“On this occasion, Hon’ble President was also invited for the virtual program of Visitor’s Conference on ‘Implementation of National Education Policy (NEP-2020)’ to be held on September 19, 2020,” he added.All higher institutions including the Vice-Chancellors of Central Universities, Directors of Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs), National Institute of Technology (NITs), Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) from across the country are expected to participate in this program and “pave the way for the implementation of the new education policy”.
An ordinance is a temporary law made by the President of India (on the advice of the central government) when Parliament is not in session. An ordinance becomes a permanent Act (the law of the land) on being approved by Parliament within six weeks of reassembly.As Parliament convenes amid the Covid-19 pandemic from Monday, it will need to consider and approve ordinances promulgated over the past six months. Since March 24, when the lockdown was imposed, 11 ordinances have been signed by the President.With every session, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is brazenly rewriting the rules of Parliament. Cancel Question Hour, so the Opposition isn’t given a chance to hold the government accountable. Slash Zero Hour time by half, from 60 minutes to 30 minutes, to deprive the Opposition of raising issues of importance. Misuse a constitutional tool such as an ordinance to mock Parliament, in a way it hasn’t been done in 70 years.Five of the 11 ordinances are broadly related to the outcome of Covid-19, coupled with two in the health sector. All the other ordinances are unrelated to the pandemic, including the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Ordinance, and the three ordinances related to agriculture.These are the 11 ordinances that Parliament will be required to approve in the coming fortnight.Many previous Presidents have raised questions about individual ordinances. The current President, in his wisdom, prefers to go ahead without asking questions. Unchecked, the BJP government has embraced an unfortunate culture of ordinances. Some statistics are revealing. In the first 30 years of our parliamentary democracy, there was one ordinance promulgated for every 10 Bills introduced in Parliament. In the following 30 years, the ratio was two ordinances for every 10 Bills. In the 16th Lok Sabha (2014-19), the number jumped to 3.5 ordinances for every 10 Bills. In the current Lok Sabha it is, so far, 3.3 ordinances to every 10 Bills.Look at it another way. Between 1998 and 2004, when the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance was in office, the government promulgated 9.6 ordinances a year. Between 2004-09 (United Progressive Alliance-I), 7.2 ordinances were issued a year and for UPA-II, it was down to five a year. Between 2014 and 2019, in the first term of the Narendra Modi government, the number shot up to 10 ordinances a year. About 10 ordinances were issued on the eve of the 2019 general election. Clearly, the BJP has a preference for short-circuiting democracy.Ordinances have to be approved by Parliament within six weeks of reassembly. So, is there really a problem, or are we in the Opposition only being sticklers? No, there is a problem. In fact, two problems. One, the BJP government thinks nothing of re-promulgating ordinances that have lapsed. This is a breach of convention and extremely undemocratic. But the Modi government has done it more than once. Two, a bill that seeks post-facto approval for an ordinance is often rushed through the House. The deliberation and fine-tuning, the pre-legislative stakeholder consultations and the committee scrutiny, are important stages in the passage of a law. Ordinances that hurriedly become Bills and then Acts bypass this process.Is the BJP government guilty of pushing laws that it wants in place without adequate parliamentary discussion or scrutiny by Parliament committees? Or while the country is distracted by a pandemic? Consider a few of the recent ordinances.The Banking Regulation (Amendment) Ordinance is a response to the Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative Bank scandal. There have been two parliamentary sessions since the scandal became public knowledge, and no draft bill was introduced.Similarly, permitting corporate farming, and liberalising agricultural trade regimes as well as produce movement to benefit big retailers, should have been preceded by adequate parliamentary debate.These are significant and controversial decisions. Has care been taken to address the information asymmetry between farmers who sell and big traders and corporations that buy? This could have been scrutinised by a parliamentary committee. The ordinance glosses over it — passing itself off as either pandemic relief to farmers or an economic reform. It is neither. The timing of such ordinances is very odd and no coronavirus-related gap is being filled.This problematic ordinance culture has extended to BJP-run states as well. During the lockdown, BJP governments in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat issued ordinances diluting labour laws, without consulting worker unions and civil rights groups.Even the International Labour Organisation advised caution. On March 15, just before the lockdown, the Uttar Pradesh Recovery of Damages to Public and Private Property Ordinance was promulgated.It sought to impose punitive fines on those who damaged public and private properties during protests. This is a law reminiscent of the colonial era.To support and enable the implementation of the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, the central government is pushing states to amend their Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee Acts. This will minimise the role of state market committees and risk creating agricultural cartels of big food businesses and retailers. Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, and Karnataka have acted as per command and promptly promulgated ordinances.Where will this stop?Post Script: There are only three parliamentary democracies in the world that permit the ordinance route — India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. The practice in India was adopted from the Government of India Act, 1935, where the viceroy could do as he pleased. In every other country, Parliament has to be convened in order to get a law passed.Derek O’Brien is the parliamentary leader of the Trinamool Congress in the Rajya SabhaThe views expressed are personal
Every effort to develop a new medicine is like launching a ship across the ocean to hunt for riches. Over the years, we’ve improved the hulls and masts, the maps are better, the sailors more experienced. But even so, vessels get turned back or new lands are barren. And, sometimes, a squall takes down the boat and all her crew.The Trump administration has set sail on one of the most ambitious vaccine development efforts in history. Operation Warp Speed is likely to deliver a Covid-19 inoculation in a fraction of the years it would usually take. In doing, so it could save the lives of hundreds of thousands of people and economies around the world.But the administration has also offered timelines for a vaccine that fly in the face of almost every experience in pharmaceutical history. On Tuesday night, President Donald Trump said a shot could be ready in three or four weeks. Then, on Wednesday, Paul Mango, deputy chief of staff for policy at the Department of Health and Human Services and one of the senior leaders of the Warp Speed program, said every American could be vaccinated by the end of March.Mango said that there are enough doses in production and that trials are moving at a speed so that “the combination of those two will permit us to vaccinate every American before the end of first quarter 2021.”A few hours later, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said that “we do believe that it will be widely available by the end of” this year, though also referred to doses of the vaccine being production by then, as opposed to actually distributed.Mango’s and McEnany ’s remarks were contradicted by the head of the Centers for Disease Control Prevention, Director Robert Redfield, who told Congress Wednesday that it would likely take until late spring or the summer of next year for most Americans to have access to a vaccine. Other top U.S. health officials have said it’s not likely a vaccine will be ready until the end of the year, and that expanding access to the more than 300 million people living in the U.S. will take longer.“It would be aspirational to do that,” said Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “But I think it’s more toward the middle to the end of the year that you can get people vaccinated. It depends on what the vaccine is.”The U.S. has launched many ships. Pfizer Inc., Moderna Inc. and AstraZeneca Plc have headed out at a rapid clip. The early data look promising, and late-stage trials in tens of thousands of volunteers could produce a rapid answer.But to deploy a vaccine widely by early next year, it’s worth keeping in mind what has to go right:Even in vaccination efforts that the U.S. runs every year, it’s hard to meet the goal of wide uptake. For the 2017-2018 flu season, only 37% of Americans actually got a vaccine, according to the CDC. Many people get it at work, at school, at a drugstores or in hospitals --places that are largely closed or that many Americans are avoiding because of the pandemic.There are a few loosely understood rules of running a pharmaceutical company, outside the necessity of making a reasonable return for shareholders.A first rule is don’t kill anyone. A second one is to help people live longer, better lives. The third is not to get sued by securities regulators.It’s a simple set of goals that often runs into the brutal reality of drug development, often summed up by insiders with the oft-repeated pearl, “science is hard.” Every year, the pharmaceutical industry spends billions on failure. Drugs seem like miracles, then turn out to be a mirage. Much of the money companies invest in research goes toward projects that are stopped because they either don’t help people or might hurt them.The result is that most companies -- there are, of course, exceptions -- are conservative in their pronouncements. And some have been in preparing for a vaccine. Merck & Co. has been quietly betting that the first shot across the line won’t necessarily be the best, and that its experimental vaccine could top the early winners. Some form of vaccine is likely to be needed for years, as well, leaving plenty of room for incremental improvements like better protection, more durable immunity, and more certain safety.To that end, earlier this month, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine published a report summarizing expert recommendations for distributing a Covid-19 vaccine.On page 11, it cites a key lesson from past mass vaccination efforts: “Under-promise and over-deliver.”Having violated the first half of that advice, the best hope now is that the U.S. delivers on the second.
Malaika Arora, who had tested positive for Covid-19, seems to have finally moved out of quarantine and reunited with her family. The actor has shared a picture from her bedroom on her Instagram Stories and captioned it, “Reunited.”The picture shows Malaika’s feet with her dog Casper sitting besides her on the bed. She seems to be watching a film or a show featuring Sarah Jessica Parker as she also enjoys the view from her balcony.Malaika had shared a glimpse of her time in quarantine on Instagram. It showed her son Arhaan and dog Casper looking at her from the other balcony. “Love knows no boundaries. With our social distancing and self quarantine in place, we still find a way to check on each other, see each other and talk. While my heart breaks to not be able to hug my two babies for another few days, just looking at their sweet faces gives me so much courage and energy to power through,” she had written in caption.Malaika had been shooting for the show India’s Best Dancer when she decided to undergo the test. Talking about how she dealt with it, Malaika told Mid-Day in an interview, “Luckily, my family had not contracted the virus. I was shocked when I tested positive because I had not shown any major symptoms or experienced discomfort. I was advised to self-quarantine at home. I made sure that I didn’t step out of my room, and didn’t come in contact with anyone, including my son (Arhaan), the house staff and our dog Casper.”She revealed how it affected her fitness routine but she made sure to do at least some basic breathing exercises during the period. She said, “I did not have breathlessness, but showed some mild symptoms. I complained of weakness, which tends to happen when your body is fighting a disease. While I couldn’t practise my yoga routine as I was weak, I made sure I performed the basic asanas, and practised breathing exercises like anulom vilom and kapalbhati.”Malaika had shared the news of her testing positive on September 7. She had written on Instagram, “Today I have tested positive for coronavirus, but I want to inform you all that I am feeling fine. I am asymptomatic and following all the required protocols and will be quarantined at home as instructed by my doctor and authorities. I request all of you to stay calm and safe. Thank you for all your support. Much love, Malaika Arora.”
Legendary Indian cricketer Sunil Gavaskar named the ‘biggest game-changer’ in T20 format. Gavaskar bestowed the to West Indies and Kolkata Knight Riders all-rounder Andre Russell.Gavaskar’s comments came just ahead of the IPL 2020 opener between four-time champions Mumbai Indians and three-time winners Chennai Super Kings on Saturday in Abu Dhabi.“In Andre Russell the side (KKR) has the biggest game-changer in this format,” Gavaskar wrote in his column for Sportstar.Andre Russell has been a prolific performer for KKR in the last few seasons. Last year, Russell scored 510 runs from 13 innings at a staggering strike rate of 204.81, averaging 56.66 and also picked up 11 wickets. In the last 4 seasons of IPL, 164.91 has been Russell’s lowest strike rate, which shows what sort of an impact he has had for KKR.Also Read | Couldn’t say anything: How Dhoni’s 3-word reply made CSK pacer speechlessKKR, this year, are considering to send Russell up the order to make maximum use of his big-hitting prowess.KKR mentor and former Australia David Hussey with adequate balls at his disposal, Russell can well go on to score a double hundred in T20 cricket which nobody has ever achieved. “If it benefits the team and helps us win games of cricket, why not? If that means Andre Russell comes in at three and bats 60 balls, he might actually make a double hundred. Anything can happen with Dre Russ.”Gavaskar also said all eyes will be Australian all-rounder Pat Cummins, who was bought for 15.5 crores by KKR.Also Read | Gavaskar picks his Mumbai Indians’ Playing XI, points out team’s weakness“The Kolkata Knight Riders team has the biggest buy of the last auction in Pat Cummins. On the slow pitches, his pace may not be effective and he will have to look at other varieties to give his team the necessary breakthroughs. He can bat usefully too, but there’s no doubt that most eyes will be on how he lives up to his huge price tag,” wrote Gavaskar.Commenting on KKR’s new coaching staff led by head coach Brendon McCullum, Gavaskar said, the former New Zealand skipper will encourage the team to play fearless cricket.“KKR’s coach Brendon McCullum will encourage the team to play fearless cricket and Eoin Morgan will lend tremendous clout to the top order and his tactical acumen will be a big plus, too,” said Gavaskar.Reacting on this IPL being held in front of empty stands, Gavaskar said, it will be a different experience.“It will be a different experience altogether for the players to play in front of nobody apart from their teammates cheering for them and it could take getting used to. Mind you, those who play domestic cricket know what it feels to play in near-empty stadia, but for those internationals who hardly play domestic cricket, it will be a novel experience indeed.”
After months of delay and wrangling, the intra-Afghan peace talks finally began in Doha, Qatar, last week. These talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban delegation saw envoys and organisations from over 15 countries participating, underscoring the wider regional and global ramifications of these negotiations. Yet, the challenges were clear from the opening remarks of the main interlocutors.Abdullah Abdullah, chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation, was categorical that while “the legitimate demand of our people and the goal of peace is to end all forms of war and violence through political means,” they wanted a constitutional system in the country that would preserve democracy, elections, women’s rights, minority rights, rule of law, human and civil rights. In essence, he underlined the need to preserve the achievements of the past two decades. Mullah Baradar, Taliban’s deputy leader, tried to strike a conciliatory tone but the group has been clear about its goal: Preserving religious values and striving for an Islamic system.The United States (US) has left the choice of the political system to the Afghan government and the Taliban but has not been shy of articulating its preferences. Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, suggested “that protecting the rights of all Afghans is indeed the best way for you to break the cycle of violence”, even as he warned that the “choices and conduct” during the negotiations will affect both the size and scope of future US assistance. Earlier this year, in February, the Donald Trump administration decided to reduce its military footprint in Afghanistan; this is likely to go down to 4,500 troops by November. Though Washington is not convinced that the Taliban has weaned itself off completely from Al Qaeda or that it can be a trusted partner in ensuring peace in Afghanistan, there is a wider political consensus in the US on the need to bring troops back home. For Trump, claiming that he managed to conclude an “endless war” would be a significant policy success to highlight in his beleaguered re-election campaign.So, in more ways than one, the preference matrix of key players in these negotiations is not in sync, posing fundamental challenges to both the process and the outcome. For the Afghan government, it is essential that violence by the Taliban should cease before any substantive talks on power-sharing can begin. But for the Taliban, their ability to unleash dramatic violence is a major leverage that they would like to exploit in political negotiations.But the Taliban also seem to recognise that today’s Afghanistan is not the one they controlled from 1996 to 2001. Afghanistan’s nascent democracy has thrown up new voices, new actors and new aspirations. Reports of the Taliban engaging with China to build infrastructure after a US withdrawal is an indicator that governance is now one of the priorities which cannot be ignored. And this is where India comes into the picture.Despite the pessimism in some quarters that India has lost it all in Afghanistan, ground realities are more complex. India’s approach is also evolving in line with the changing strategic environment. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar’s remarks at the start of the intra-Afghan talks in Doha conveyed India’s priorities even as they subtly underlined its reservations. For New Delhi, it is imperative that “the peace process must be Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled, respect national sovereignty and territorial integrity of Afghanistan, promote human rights and democracy, ensure interest of minorities, women and the vulnerable, effectively address violence across the country.”India’s primary concern emanates from a perceived Pakistani victory in managing to bring the Taliban back to political power in Kabul, thereby energising Islamist extremists in South Asia to target India. India’s regional security environment could be further undermined if the Taliban let Pakistan use Afghan territory for gaining strategic depth vis-à-vis India. Then there is the China factor. Given its close ties with Pakistan, Beijing would like to ensure that the Taliban sever their ties with Uighur extremists in Xinjiang. In exchange, China might emerge as the key economic benefactor of a Taliban-dominated Afghanistan, nudging Pakistan to bring the country into the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.These are significant challenges and New Delhi must be cognisant of such pressures. But it should also remain alive to new possibilities and alignments. India’s role as Afghanistan’s largest development partner cannot be easily dismissed; it also remains the most popular country for ordinary Afghans. New Delhi has strong ties with not only the US and Europe, which will be critical for Afghanistan’s economic reconstruction long after foreign military forces leave, but also with neighbours such as Russia and Iran, key for Afghanistan’s strategic autonomy. The Pashtun question which divides Pakistan and Afghanistan also gives New Delhi significant leverage. It is, therefore, not surprising that the Taliban have been signalling their intent to engage with India. They seem to get the salience of New Delhi in the Afghan matrix much better than many in India.Harsh V Pant is professor, King’s College, London, and director of studies, Observer Research Foundation, New DelhiThe views expressed are personal
US President Donald Trump on Saturday said he intended to move “without delay” to name a candidate for the vacancy left on the Supreme Court by the demise of justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.“We were put in this position of power and importance to make decisions for the people who so proudly elected us, the most important of which has long been considered to be the selection of United States Supreme Court justices,” Trump tweeted, adding, “We have this obligation, without delay!”Amul Thapar on Trump’s shortlist for successorTrump has not indicated who he will name and when, but Indian-American Amul Thapar is among the top few he is considering, according to multiple media reports. Thapar’s name was on the US president’s shortlist to replace justice Stephen Kennedy in 2018, but he eventually picked Brett Kavanaugh. Thapar, 51, is a judge on the 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals.Trump thanked former Senate leader Harry Reid, a Democrat, for removing a rule that required 60 votes to confirm a nominee. Republicans have a 53-47 majority in the Senate. All presidential nominations to certain federal positions must be confirmed or rejected by the Senate.Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell has already indicated that he is ready to start the process, saying in a statement that Trump’s nominee will get a vote.In 2016, he had blocked president Barack Obama’s nominee for the Supreme Court, saying it must be left to the next president, even though elections were due after nine months.
Indian-American judge Amul Thapar is among the top names being considered by US President Donald Trump to replace Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, according to multiple media reports. Ginsburg died on Friday at the age of 87.Trump, who on Saturday indicated that he wanted to move “without delay” on naming a replacement, has not indicated who it will be or when. But he has had a list of potential candidates for a long time, which he updated recently with 20 names.Thapar has been on the list for a while and had made it to the list of names as a possible candidate to succeed Justice Stephen Kennedy, who retired in 2018. He lost that race to Brett Kavanaugh.Thapar, 51 is a judge on the 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals.“We were put in this position of power and importance to make decisions for the people who so proudly elected us, the most important of which has long been considered to be the selection of United States Supreme Court Justices,” the US president tweeted, adding, “We have this obligation, without delay!”In another post, Trump thanked former Senate leader Harry Reid, a Democrat, for removing a rule that required 60 votes to confirm a nominee. Republicans have a 53-47 majority in the Senate. All presidential nominations to certain federal positions must be confirmed or rejected by the Senate.Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell has already indicated that he is ready to start the process, saying in a statement that the US president’s nominee will get a vote. In 2016, he had blocked president Barack Obama’s nominee for the Supreme Court, saying it must be left to the next president even though elections were due after nine months.Thapar has been on Trump’s list for quite a while. He had been considered in 2017 to replace Antonin Scalia. Trump eventually went with Neil Gorsuch. Later in the year, he named Thapar to the Cincinnati-based Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.Thapar was confirmed by a 52-44 vote, becoming only the second Indian-American judge of an appeals court. Shri Srinivasan, who was appointed to the DC circuit court of appeals by Obama and confirmed in 2013, was the first.Thapar, 47, was born in Detroit to immigrants from India, Raj Thapar and Veena Bhalla. He went to college in Boston, and studied law at University of California, Berkeley.
Militant group Hezbollah has stored chemicals that can be used to make explosives in several European countries, a senior State Department official said as he appealed to countries in Europe and elsewhere to impose bans on the organization.Hezbollah operatives have moved ammonium nitrate from Belgium to France, Greece, Italy, Spain and Switzerland in recent years and are suspected to still be storing the material throughout Europe, said Nathan Sales, the State Department coordinator for counter-terrorism, on Thursday.Ammonium nitrate is a chemical compound commonly used as a fertilizer, but it can be used to make explosives. It can also be dangerous in storage, as demonstrated by the huge explosion last month in the Lebanese capital of Beirut.Sales, without offering evidence, said the US believes that Iran-backed Hezbollah has since 2012 transported ammonium nitrate around Europe in first aid kits with cold packs that contain the compound. The United States believes these supplies are still in place throughout Europe, possibly in Greece, Italy and Spain.“Why would Hezbollah stockpile ammonium nitrate on European soil?” he said. “The answer is clear: Hezbollah put these weapons in place so it could conduct major terrorist attacks whenever it or its masters in Tehran deemed necessary.” Sales made the remarks in an online forum hosted by the American Jewish Committee, which has called upon more countries to ban Hezbollah and its operations.The US has designated Hezbollah as a foreign terrorist organization since 1997, but some countries distinguish between the organization’s military wing and the political wing.The EU lists Iran-backed Hezbollah’s military wing as a banned terrorist group, but not its political wing, which has been part of Lebanese governments in recent years. Some individual countries, including Germany and the UK, have outlawed the group in its entirety. Sales called on more countries to do the same.Hezbollah is a “unitary organization that cannot be subdivided into a military and so-called political wing,” he said. Without a full ban, the group can still raise money and recruit operatives. “Hezbollah is one organization,” he said. “It is a terrorist organization.”
Both Venue and Sonet have brought something new for the Indian customers, that will change the way people are accustomed to driving cars. The much talked about iMT transmission is a shared technology between the two. Besides, there are several other features and elements, like turbo variants, that are common between the two sub-compact SUVs.But there are elements that promise to set Sonet apart from Venue and can be a dealmaker or deal-breaker.Diesel torque converter anyone?Kia Sonet has an extensive engine/transmission lineup.A 1-litre turbo engine with iMT or regular transmission in a car of this size always promises to be peppy and fun to drive anywhere. But Kia decided to bring in the 1.5-litre CRDi diesel engine that powers the Seltos SUV in Sonet as well. This specific engine, mated to a 6-speed torque converter, is one of the biggest differences between Sonet and Venue. It can produce 115 PS of power and 250 Nm of torque.‘Drive anywhere’ modesNo. Sonet is not a four-wheel drive. So no need to get excited about different terrain modes it offers. However, it can prove to be helpful when required. The three modes - snow, mud and sand - will not make a major difference in performance when the Sonet is pushed into such scenarios where you need such modes to kick in, but may well edge out of a sticky situation.Bigger is better?Kia boasts of a 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system.Kia Sonet boasts of a bigger touchscreen infotainment system than the one that comes inside the Hyundai Venue. The 10.25-inch screen is similar to the one inside Kia Seltos. Besides Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and AI voice recognition, it has a connected car technology called UVO, which is not too different from Hyundai Blue Link connectivity found inside a Venue.Light and sound showKia Sonet comes with Bose sound system with mood lighting feature﻿Kia Sonet gets 7-speaker Bose sound system which comes with LED Sound Mood Lights that keeps changing. Hyundai Venue comes with 6-speaker Arkamys audio.Front proximity sensorsBesides the regular rear parking sensors that are common in most cars, Kia Sonet comes with a front parking sensor too. It not only helps while parking the car in a tight spot, but can also help the car negotiate narrow lanes or start-and-stop traffic in the city.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Friday laid down guidelines for appointment of chief compliance officer (CCO) in banks to ensure uniform approach with regard to compliance and risk management culture across the banking industry.According to an RBI circular, the CCO should be appointed for a minimum fixed period of three years in the rank of a general manager or not below two levels of the rank of CEO.“Such an independent compliance function is required to be headed by a designated CCO selected through a suitable process with an appropriate ‘fit and proper’ evaluation/selection criteria to manage compliance risk effective,” the RBI said.Observing that the banks follow diverse practices in this regard, the RBI said guidelines are meant to bring uniformity in approach followed by banks, to align the supervisory expectations on CCOs with best practices.As per the guidelines, a CCO “may be transferred/ removed before completion of the tenure only in exceptional circumstances with the explicit prior approval of the board after following a well-defined and transparent internal administrative procedure”.The CCO, it added, should be a senior executive of the bank, preferably in the rank of a general manager or an equivalent position (not below two levels from the CEO). The CCO could also be recruited from the market.Further, there shall not be any “dual hatting”, the RBI said. In other words, the CCO “shall not be given any responsibility which brings elements of conflict of interest, especially the role relating to business”.Roles which do not attract direct conflict of interest like role of anti-money laundering officer can be performed by the CCO in those banks where principle of proportionality in terms of bank’s size, complexity, risk management strategy and structures justifies that.Also, the CCO should not be a member of any committee which brings his/her role in conflict with responsibility as member of the committee, including any committee dealing with purchases/ sanctions, it said.“In case the CCO is member of a committee, he/she may have only advisory role,” the guidelines said.As per the circular, no vigilance case or adverse observation from the RBI should be pending against the candidate identified for appointment as the CCO.Selection of the candidate for the post of the CCO should be done on the basis of a well-defined selection process and recommendations made by the senior executive-level selection committee constituted by the board for the purpose, it added.
Investors are lapping up initial share sales of companies that are seen to benefit from the wide changes in the business environment brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic.Initial public offerings (IPOs) of two companies that hit the market this week hold testimony to the buoyant investor sentiment for such companies even as the pandemic wreaks havoc on the economy. Happiest Minds Technologies Ltd’s IPO, which closed on Wednesday, saw a total subscription of 151 times, while Route Mobile Ltd, which closes on Friday, has been subscribed 4.21 times so far. Both were fully subscribed on their opening day; a rare feat for most IPOs. Investors took notice that Happiest Minds derives 97% of its revenues from digital IT services such as cloud, SaaS, security, analytics and IoT, compared to 30-50% for traditional Indian IT services peers. Meanwhile, Route Mobile is a cloud–communication platform provider, catering to enterprises, over-the-top (OTT) players and mobile network operators.Market experts said investors are rushing to subscribe to such offerings because these issuers are experiencing positive tailwinds for their businesses due to the pandemic. A drought of local IPOs since March, leading to a pent-up appetite for them, is helping as well, they said.“Where capital is being raised for growth and where Covid has redefined the sector and the business is doing better, those companies are bound to see much more traction from investors in the IPO market,” said Venkatraghavan S, managing director and head-equity capital markets at Equirus Capital.Rahul Singh, chief investment officer-equities at Tata Mutual Fund, added that the fundraisings have now moved beyond banks which raised capital to prepare for worsening credit cycle. “Now we see the fundraising more as growth capital for the new sectors with tailwinds post Covid, i.e. digital transformation, chemicals and electronic manufacturing,” said Singh. Several firms that are benefiting from the effects of the pandemic are expected to launch IPOs in the coming weeks. These include brokerage Angel Broking Ltd, registrar and transfer agent Computer Age Management Services Pvt. Ltd (CAMS) and specialty chemicals maker Chemcon Specialty Chemicals.“Post Covid, a lot of new investors have come into the stock markets and thus brokerages are seeing a strong momentum, which will help Angel Broking. CAMS, which provides back-end services to mutual funds, is also benefiting from this influx of new investors while specialty chemicals have become attractive as global companies look to reduce their dependence on China following the pandemic,” said an investment banker, on the condition of anonymity.
Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap has weighed in on the insider-outsider debate in Bollywood. Anurag said that with the advancement of OTT platforms, there are a lot more opportunities for outsiders to prove their talent.Anurag has even spoken about how Ranveer Singh suffered multiple rejections in his career, despite being dubbed an insider for his very distant connection with Anil Kapoor’s family. Anurag said that Ranveer had auditioned for Shaitan but was rejected. He even wanted to make Bombay Velvet with him but the studios threatened to back out if he did.Speaking to journalist Faye D’Souza, Anurag said, “However much people call him an insider because of some remote connection, from two generations before, the man has struggled. Ranveer Singh was rejected in an audition in Shaitan. Ranveer Singh is an actor who when I wanted to cast him in Bombay Velvet, I had a tough time. My studios and nobody believed in me and told me they will not give me money if I made the film with him. So even that Ranveer Singh, that I know two personal stories of my own production that rejected him, he is a star today.”Actor Ranbir Kapoor was ultimately brought on as the lead in Bombay Velvet opposite Anushka Sharma. The film proved to be a flop at the box office and was also widely panned by critics.Anurag also talked about how he and Kangana Ranaut had fought nepotism early in their careers. “See nepotism was a debate of 2000, the early decade. Right now, with OTT coming into the picture, that debate is pointless. There are much more opportunities on OTT, there are much more outsiders coming in. That was the time I fought that battle. When me and Kangana were friends and were like ‘We will do this film’. How many people believed in Queen? Nobody did. We went down and fought that battle. This industry was about supporting their people, like any other business,” he said.Anurag and Kangana have been at loggerheads lately for their opposing views on Bollywood’s drug abuse issue, politics, nationalism and more. Recently, when Kangana talked about she was a warrior, ready to serve her country, Anurag joked that she should fight with the troops against China. Kangana, in turn, called him a fool for not understanding her metaphor.
To ensure that no children are left behind in education in the COVID pandemic situation, governments should distribute textbooks, free smartphones or tablets to all school children, an NGO has said. Also, states should provide free data package or reimburse the cost of data, which would also require substantial investment to strengthen digital infrastructure including the regular supply of electricity to all households, child right NGO CRY said in a report.Read More| Provide gadgets, internet pack to poor students for online classes: Delhi HC to schools“A clear roadmap with timelines needs to be developed to ensure inclusive digital infrastructure are some of the key measures required for delivering online classes to the last mile child,” the report released on Tuesday said.The report expressed concern for many of the children who have been excluded from school education during the COVID pandemic and voiced fear that they may not be able to return to schools again.“Even if they do, a large number of children would not find a level playing field anymore,” it said.The CRY report also dwelt on the pandemic-triggered disruption in school meal services affecting the nutrition of 6-17 years children.“As schools are closed across the country, the school feeding programme could no longer provide the much-needed free lunch to 115.9 million children who are enrolled under the Mid-Day Meal (MDM) scheme.To cater to the hunger of millions of children who depend on MDM as their source of only nutrition, government needs to devise newer ways of delivering meals till schools are closed, it said.Also, MDM coverage including the breakfast scheme need to be extended till secondary level, which clearly highlights the need for a significant increase in the MDM budget in the current and forthcoming financial years by the government, it said.The report calls for developing systems for doorstep delivery of supplementary nutrition in the form of cooked food or take home ration for young children.To discuss some of the critical policy issues and practical challenges relating to public provisioning of education for the children within 3 to 17 years during and beyond the pandemic, CRY and Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability (CBGA) recently organised a Webinar that brought together academicians, policy experts, civil society leaders and child rights defenders.Underscoring the need to look into the public provisioning framework for childrens education, Priti Mahara, Director, Policy, Research and Advocacy at CRY said at the webinar, humanitarian crises tend to hit the most vulnerable children the hardest, and COVID-19 is no exception.“It is evident how it has impacted school education, created a digital divide, limited access to social welfare, and compromised health and nutrition schemes provided through schools. To address the new normal in education sector and to universalise education, adequate public provisioning will play a very crucial role.” It should be taken into account that childrens education, especially secondary education, had been traditionally under-prioritised and suffered further set back during the pandemic, Mahara said.The suggestions emerging from the discussion will be collated and shared with the union and state governments with reference to the processes of revision of budget allocations for the current fiscal year (2020-21) and preparation of fresh budget estimates for the fiscal year 2021-22, which will be underway very soon, Mahara of CRY said.The suggestions included measures like making upward revision of scholarship amounts for marginalised children, developing inclusive learning solutions especially for the most vulnerable and marginalised sections of the society.The other suggestions are substantial resource allocation from both Union and state governments, recruiting special educators, adhering to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 to meet the needs of different types of students with disabilities and an overall focus on equity and inclusion in policy making and investment among others.“Amid the range of recommendations, it is absolutely crucial for the union and state governments to provide enough fiscal support for ensuring equitable and effective access to education for children,” it said.
Maharashtra Higher and Technical Education Minister Uday Samant on Thursday announced three days’ extension for students to submit applications for the last year/semester examinations of Mumbai University. Samant was speaking to reporters after holding a review meeting on examinations of Mumbai University, which has highest enrollment of students in the state.“The varsity has extended the period for submission of exam applications to September 20. 2,47,500 students would appear for the exams,” he said.Read More| Mumbai University final year exams: Colleges don’t have to share question bank with students, say principals1,70,000 of these students are regular ones while the rest are taking the exam to clear backlog, he said.The result certificates will have no mention of exam being held during COVID-19 pandemic, he clarified.Such a mention had appeared on some passing certificates issued by an agriculture university in the state earlier, which had drawn criticism.“The certificate will be normal, a regular piece of paper,” said the minister.Mumbai University’s practical exams began from September 15, while that for backlog papers will be held from September 25, he said.It is going to be an online examination but those who do not have the online facility will be allowed to appear physically, the minister said.
Updated: Sep 13, 2020 19:42 ISTGold was sold by physical dealers on discounted price for a fourth straight week amid weak demand even though there has been a sharp decline in the yellow metal’s rates since last month’s highs.Demand for gold in the country has been hit by the coronavirus pandemic and high prices. It has also been affected by the beginning of the ‘Shradh’ period, considered inauspicious for buying assets.Gold demand usually sees an uptick ahead of the October-November festival season but dealers have said that a worsening coronavirus pandemic and the weak economy has dented sentiment. India’s coronavirus disease tally has mounted to 4,754,356 and the death toll has climbed to 78,586, data showed. And, the country’s economy contracted by 23.9% in April-June period quarter.Gold prices in India ended the week at Rs 51,280 per 10 gram and have been down nearly Rs 5,000 from record highs of Rs 56,200 last month. However, gold is up about 30% since the beginning of this year, tracking a global rally.According to a Reuters report, dealers offered discounts of $30 an ounce over official domestic prices as compared to last week’s $40.Experts have said developments on the anti-coronavirus vaccine front and improving economic data present near-term headwinds to gold but low and negative interest rates, weaker US dollar and expectations of further stimulus will keep the yellow metal supported.Gold prices in India, which is the second-biggest buyer after China, include 12.5% import duty and 3% GST.India’s gold imports declined 81.22% to $ 2.47 billion or Rs 18,590 crore in the April-July period of the current fiscal. Gold imports affect the country’s current account deficit (CAD). According to data from the ministry of commerce, the demand for gold has come down considerably in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, which has, in turn, reduced imports.(With agency inputs)
The US Embassy in Afghanistan is warning that extremists groups are planning attacks against a “variety of targets” but are taking particular aim at women.The warning issued late Thursday doesn’t specify the organizations plotting the attacks, but it comes as the Taliban and government-appointed negotiators are sitting together for the first time to try to find a peaceful end to decades of relentless war.The “Taliban don’t have any plans to carry out any such attacks,” spokesman Zabihullah Mujahed told The Associated Press on Friday.Peace negotiations underway in Qatar, where the Taliban maintain a political office, are in the initial stages with participants still hammering out what items on the agenda will be negotiated and when.Washington’s peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad said at the start of negotiations last weekend that spoilers existed on both sides. He said that some among Afghanistan’s many leaders would be content to continue with the status quo rather than find a peaceful end to the war that might involve power sharing.According to the embassy warning, “extremist organizations continue to plan attacks against a variety of targets in Afghanistan, including a heightened risk of attacks targeting female government and civilian workers, including teachers, human rights activists, office workers, and government employees.”The embassy did not provide specifics, including how imminent is the threat.The Taliban have been harshly criticized for their treatment of women and girls during their five-year rule when the insurgent group denied girls access to school and women to work outside their home. The Taliban rule ended in 2001 when a U.S.-led coalition ousted the hard-line regime for its part in sheltering al-Qaida, which was responsible for the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States.One of the government-appointed peace negotiators, Fawzia Koofi, a strong, outspoken proponent of women’s rights, was shot last month in Afghanistan, but escaped serious injuries and attended the opening of negotiations last weekend. The Taliban quickly denied responsibility and Khalilzad again warned of the dangers to the process.The United States has said that perhaps one of the most dangerous extremist groups operating in Afghanistan is the Islamic State affiliate, headquartered in the country’s east and held responsible for some of the most recent attacks. The IS affiliate has declared war on minority Shiite Muslims and has claimed credit for horrific attacks targeting them.The United Nations as well as Afghanistan’s many international allies have stressed the need for any peace deal to protect the rights of women and minorities. Negotiations are expected to be difficult and protracted and will also include constitutional changes, disarming the tens of thousands of the Taliban as well as militias loyal to warlords, some of whom are allied with the government.The advances for women made since 2001 have been important. Women are now members of parliament, girls have the right to education, women are in the workforce and their rights are enshrined in the constitution. Women are also seen on television, playing sports and winning science fairs.But the gains are fragile, and their implementation has been erratic, largely unseen in rural areas where most Afghans still live.The 2018 Women, Peace and Security Index rated Afghanistan as the second worst place in the world to be a woman, after Syria. Only 16% of the labor force are women, one of the lowest rates in the world, and half of Afghanistan’s women have had four years or less of education, according to the report, which was compiled by the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security and the Peace Research Institute of Oslo. Only around half of school-aged girls go to school, and only 19% of girls under 15 are literate, according to the U.N. children’s agency.Nearly 60% of girls are married before they are 19, on average between 15 and 16 years old, to spouses selected by their parents, according to UNICEF.Until now, parliament has been unable to ratify a bill on the protection of women.There are also Islamic hard-liners among the politically powerful in Kabul, including Abdul Rasul Sayyaf, who is the inspiration behind the Philippine terrorist group Abu Sayyaf, and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a U.S.-designated militant who made peace with President Ashraf Ghani’s government in 2016.
The new National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 has been received with broad praise. The goal of universalisation of Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) and the focus on achieving universal foundational literacy and numeracy (FLN) is especially laudable. The challenge now lies in translating policy into action on the ground at scale. Most policy suggestions are not new — several state governments have been trying hard to implement such reforms. However, the lack of consistent political will and the slow pace of adopting emerging technologies have stymied these efforts. We know how to educate children, as is evident in elite schools — our inability to do so for all children is due to the failure in understanding the role of politics and technology.How are parents, from less-privileged backgrounds, expected to understand the value of the current reforms such as curriculum overhaul, teacher-training or activity-based learning in schools? These are all hidden behind school walls, parents are not involved, and the visible impact of better education manifests later in life. As a result, the public-school system has lost the perception battle to the private system. The latter takes huge pains to dazzle their most critical constituency — parents — through fancy brochures or computer labs. Public educators tend to be poor publicists.Unfortunately, NEP ignores the political-economy aspects of education and the critical need to involve the parent as a teacher and voter. Parents are only mentioned 25 times, as compared to 221 mentions for teachers. The opaqueness of progress and lack of value realisation by the constituents is why politicians across the spectrum have, in turn, not paid attention to education, as compared to other sectors such as infrastructure and skills training. Education reform attempts come and go, based on the whims and fancies of officials and their unpredictable tenures.Even beyond political incentives, it is vital that parents are involved directly in the learning process of their children. Such home effects have been shown to be key drivers of learning outcomes. Parent and community engagement is not just a political carrot, but also essential for the child’s progress. Models designed to include teachers as key facilitators for parent interactions also increase community respect for teachers, another key objective of the NEP. Across the board, teachers are motivated by how parents value them more, realise the positive things happening in school, and express their admiration for their efforts — in comparison even to private schools.Recently, we see that, when parents notice education improvements, it translates into political popularity — Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh are all early examples. In this context, governments and politicians will only do the hard slog to translate NEP into reality if their efforts are easily visible and impressive to parents, a key voting bloc.A natural question is, how? How can we bring parents on board and achieve universal FLN throughout India? How can government achieve this scale with a high Return on Investment (ROI)?The answer has been staring us in the face all along — the digital revolution. India is expected to have 820 million smartphone users by 2022 and, for the first time, India has more rural Internet users than urban. This is the time to use these tail winds and adopt innovative low-tech to enable school-home connections and engage parents where they are.Specifically, school systems need to leverage technology and mass media communication to show parents daily and directly that they are investing in their children’s success, and that the child is actually learning. Technology can play a key role in bringing about this behavioural change by implementing the Aspiration, Information & Measurement (AIM) framework. We can use social media platforms such as Facebook and Youtube to bring about awareness, we can leverage messaging platforms such as WhatsApp and Telegram to disseminate educational content to learning communities, and we can use Artificial Intelligence and Big-Data to measure these learning outcomes at scale. The possibilities are endless. Now is the time to commit to an approach spearheaded by technology and digital India.There is evidence of the effectiveness and high ROI for tech-enabled information interventions. Many research studies have shown that low-cost interventions such as text message nudge the learning process along. In our organisation, Rocket Learning, we have seen that tech- and media-enabled models of leveraging government infrastructure to build parental aspiration, information gateways and, social motivation have led to up to 80% of parents conducting learning activities with children on a regular basis district-wide.The writing on the wall is clear — for the system to change for the long-term, we need initiatives and technology that achieve both educational and political success, as was the case with the midday meal scheme. It is imperative that the recently announced FLN mission, which builds on NEP, both addresses the political economy problem and adopts technology quickly to achieve universal ECCE. It must be accompanied by a national mass media and social media campaign that specifically targets communities, as in Swachh Bharat or Skill India. The mission must create a virtuous cycle of governments pulling parents along and vice versa.Azeez Gupta and Vishal Sunil are serial entrepreneurs with backgrounds from Pratham, McKinsey, Harvard Business School and IIT Delhi.

The Delhi High Court Friday directed private as well as government schools to provide gadgets and an internet package to poor students for online classes, saying the absence of such facilities prevent children from pursuing elementary education.A bench of Justices Manmohan and Sanjeev Narula said private unaided schools “shall be entitled to claim reimbursement of reasonable cost for procurement of the equipment and internet package from the State under the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009, even though the State is not providing the same to its students”.The bench directed constitution of a three-member committee, comprising education secretary from the Centre or his nominee, Delhi government’s education secretary or his nominee and a representative of the private schools, to expedite and streamline the process of identifying and supplying the gadgets to poor and disadvantaged students.The court said the committee shall also frame standard operating procedures (SOPs) for identifying the standard of the equipment and internet package to be supplied to the poor and disadvantaged students.This would ensure uniformity in the gadgets and internet package being used by all the poor and disadvantaged students, the bench said. The judgment came on a PIL by NGO Justice for All, represented by advocate Khagesh Jha, seeking directions to the Centre and the Delhi government to provide free laptops, tablets or mobile phones to poor kids so that they can access classes online during the COVID-19 lockdown
Barbados should become a republic and leave its colonial past behind, a top official said on Wednesday, after the Caribbean island nation said it wants to remove Britain’s Queen Elizabeth as its head of state.A former British colony that gained independence in 1966, the nation of just under 300,000 has maintained a formal link with the British monarchy as have some other countries that were once part of the British empire.“The time has come to fully leave our colonial past behind,” said Barbados Governor General Sandra Mason, delivering a speech on behalf of the country’s Prime Minister Mia Mottley.Mottley won a landslide victory in 2018.“Barbadians want a Barbadian head of state. This is the ultimate statement of confidence in who we are and what we are capable of achieving,” Mason said.“Hence, Barbados will take the next logical step toward full sovereignty and become a republic by the time we celebrate our 55th anniversary of independence.”That anniversary will come in November 2021.But on the Caribbean island nation the suggestion has been met with skepticism.The idea of becoming a republic has been put forward by different governments over the past decades.More recently, there has been frustration with the government’s delay in removing colonial ea statues.The bronze statue of Admiral Lord Nelson, erected in 1813, still stands on Broad Street in the capital city of Bridgetown.It was scheduled for removal last month when different countries around the world started removing similar statues from public spaces as protests against racism grew.Roy R. Morris, press secretary to the prime minister of Barbados, said in response to Reuters questions that there was no particular trigger for the timing of a renewed push to become a republic other than fulfilling a longstanding promise by the island’s politicians.
The Rajya Sabha on Saturday passed a legislation that provides for up to five years in jail for those attacking doctors and healthcare workers fighting the Covid-19 outbreak or during any situation akin to the current pandemic.The Epidemic Diseases (Amendment) Bill, 2020 was introduced by health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan in the Upper House on Saturday to replace an ordinance issued by the government in April.The Union Cabinet had promulgated The Epidemic Diseases (Amendment) Ordinance 2020 to amend the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, to protect healthcare service personnel and property, including their living/working premises against violence during epidemics. The bill intends to ensure that during any situation akin to the current pandemic, there is zero-tolerance to any form of violence against healthcare service personnel and damage to property.Moving an amendment bill in this regard for passage in the Upper House, the health minister said after the ordinance, such incidents against healthcare workers have declined.“We have all noticed that there has been a dramatic decline in the incidents of violence against health workers all over the country,” he said.Vardhan explained that the ordinance had to be brought as there was a rising number of incidents of harassment and violence against health workers while they were returning from their duty due to a lack of awareness about coronavirus.They were treated with stigma and not allowed to enter their houses or residential societies. They were beaten up and chased away when they went out for surveillance, he said, adding that this had significantly reduced the morale of the health workers.“Everyone was feeling sad and bad. That was the time the government thought of taking a proactive step. The government found that there were minimal laws and powers in some states. There was a need to have a central law to put in place a prohibitory mechanism to stop such activities,” Vardhan said.Binoy Viswam of the Communist Party of India (CPI), who moved a statutory resolution on the bill, said there are serious lapses in it as it does not address the issue of violence on health professionals within the hospitals.Healthcare service personnel include public and clinical healthcare service providers such as doctors, nurses, paramedical workers and community health workers; any other persons empowered under the Act to take measures to prevent the outbreak of the disease or spread thereof; and any persons declared as such by the state government, by notification in the official gazette.The penal provisions can be invoked in instances of damage to property including a clinical establishment, any facility identified for quarantine and isolation of patients, mobile medical units and any other property in which the healthcare service personnel have a direct interest in relation to the epidemic.Offences will be investigated by an officer of the rank of inspector within a period of 30 days, and trial has to be completed in one year, unless extended by the court for reasons to be recorded in writing, the bill proposes. As per its provisions, the commission or abetment of such acts of violence will be punishable with an imprisonment for a term of three months to five years, and with a fine of Rs 50,000 to Rs 2,00,000.
The World Trade Organization found on Tuesday that the United States breached global trading rules by imposing multibillion-dollar tariffs in President Donald Trump’s trade war with China, a ruling that drew anger from Washington.The Trump administration says its tariffs imposed two years ago on more than $200 billion in Chinese goods were justified because China was stealing intellectual property and forcing US companies to transfer technology for access to China’s markets.But the WTO’s three-member panel said the US duties broke trading rules because they applied only to China and were above maximum rates agreed to by the United States. Washington had not then adequately explained why its measures were a justified exception, the panel concluded.“This panel report confirms what the Trump administration has been saying for four years: the WTO is completely inadequate to stop China’s harmful technology practices,” US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in response.China’s Commerce Ministry said Beijing supported the multilateral trading system and respected WTO rules and rulings, and hoped Washington would do the same.The decision will have little immediate effect on the US tariffs and is just the start of a legal process that could take years to play out, ultimately leading to the WTO approving retaliatory measures if it is upheld - moves that China has already taken on its own.The United States is likely to appeal Tuesday’s ruling. That would put the case into a legal void, however, because Washington has already blocked the appointment of judges to the WTO’s appellate body, preventing it from convening the minimum number required to hear cases.The WTO panel was aware it was stepping into hot water. It noted that it had looked only into the US measures and not China’s retaliation, which Washington has not challenged at the WTO.“The panel is very much aware of the wider context in which the WTO system currently operates, which is one reflecting a range of unprecedented global trade tensions,” the 66-page report concluded.‘Take stock’The panel recommended the United States bring its measures “into conformity with its obligations”, but also encouraged the two sides to work to resolve the overall dispute.“Time is available for the parties to take stock as proceedings evolve and further consider opportunities for mutually agreed and satisfactory solutions,” it said.During a two-year trade war with Beijing, Trump threatened tariffs on nearly all Chinese imports - more than $500 billion - before the two countries signed a “Phase 1” trade deal in January. Extra tariffs are still in place on some $370 billion worth of Chinese goods, and $62.16 billion in duties have been collected since July 2018, US Customs data https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/trade show.Trump has described the WTO as “horrible” and biased towards China, often threatening to quit.As he left the White House for a campaign rally, Trump said he would “have to do something about the WTO because they’ve let China get away with murder.”He said he needed to take a closer look at the ruling, but added: “I’m not a big fan of the WTO - that I can tell you right now. Maybe they did us a big favor.”The decision could help fuel a Trump decision to leave the WTO or underpin US arguments for reforming the 25-year-old trade body, said Margaret Cekuta, a former USTR official who helped write a crucial report on China’s intellectual property abuses that preceded Trump’s tariffs.“It gives the administration ammo to say the WTO is out of date. If they can’t rule on intellectual property rights, then what is their position in the broader economy going forward?” said Cekuta, now a principal with the Capitol Counsel lobbying firm.Trump, critical of multilateral institutions, has already quit the U.N. cultural organisation UNESCO and plans to leave the World Health Organization.
Updated: Sep 17, 2020 19:43 ISTActor Aamir Khan’s daughter, Ira, took to Instagram to share a picture of herself doing a handstand. Ira’s post identifies her location as Panchgani.“I can hold it for long enough for @nupur_shikhare to leave the frame while someone clicks the picture. That’s about it. But baby steps, right?” she wrote in her caption. The picture shows Ira, wearing black shorts and a grey top, with a lake and hills in the background.“Oh my Goood Lord wowwwwww,” one person wrote in the comments section. “Show off,” wrote another. Actor Vijay Varma wrote, “Woaaah,” and Gulshan Devaiah commented, “Not only are you standing on your own feet, you are now standing on your own hands too.”Gulshan’s comment could be a reference to the fact that Ira recently moved into her own home, and is making professional strides as well, after directing a play. “Look at my new home,” Ira had captioned a July Instagram post.Ira is a theatre director, and made her debut with the play Euripedes’ Medea. Sharing a poster of the play in December 2019, Aamir wrote: “Break a leg Ira. Proud of you. Love. a.” The play starred Yuvraj Singh’s wife, actor Hazel Keech, in the lead role.Talking about her interest in direction, Ira had told Hindustan Times, “I’ve always felt more comfortable and enthusiastic about working off-stage or behind the camera rather than [being] in front of it. I’ve never felt the inclination to act except if it were in an action film, so I get to learn all the cool stunts. Then again.. I can just learn how to do the stunts without a film to work on.”Meanwhile, Aamir recently returned to India from Turkey, where he shot a portion of his upcoming film, Laal Singh Chaddha. The film is a remake of Hollywood hit Forrest Gump, and also stars Kareena Kapoor Khan.
After a delay of almost six months and in an entirely different country, the IPL will be played in front of empty stands for the first time ever since its inception in 2008 and there could not have been a better way to start the tournament with last year’s finalists and the two most successful teams of the richest cricket league Chennai Super Kings and Mumbai Indians taking on each other.There has been a lot of talk around who will replace Suresh Raina at No.3 in CSK’s batting line-up ever since the left-hander decided to pull out of IPL 2020. All that will be put to rest when CSK take on defending champions Mumbai Indians on Saturday in Abu Dhabi.READ| MI vs CSK Preview - The quintessential IPL blockbuster to kick things offHere is CSK’s predicted XI for the first match of IPL 2020 against Mumbai Indians.Shane Watson: The big-hitting Aussie opener is nearing the end of a decorated career and he would want to bow out in style. Watson’s virtuoso knock inspired CSK to the title in 2018 but he couldn’t replicate the same year. Watson managed to resurrect his international career with the IPL and he would want to bring the curtains down on his glorious playing days with yet another stellar season.Ambati Rayudu: He did a commendable job for CSK while opening the batting in IPL 2018. His exploits at the top of the order earned him a recall in the Indian side. With Raina not being there, Rayudu is set to get back his opening slot at least for the start of this season.Faf du Plessis: There is no one better in CSK’s squad than former South Africa captain Faf du Plessis to replace the experience and class of Suresh Raina. Du Plessis has batted at the top previously for CSK and will be one of their mainstays in their batting line-up in this year’s IPL.Kedar Jadhav: The Maharashtra little man packs a punch in the middle-order. He has had his fair share of injuries but whenever he walks out to bat, he makes sure the opposition has a battle on their hands. Raina’s absence also means Jadhav could get a permanent No.4 spot in CSK’s batting unit for this season. His round-arm off-spin will also come in handy.MS Dhoni: Do we need to say anything? It will not be an overstatement if we say that all eyes will on Dhoni when he walks out to play his first competitive cricket match after a gap of 14 months on Saturday. Dhoni had an excellent season in 2019, showcasing his power-hitting abilities are still intact. But a prolonged absence from the international scene means the seasoned campaigner needs to go all guns blazing this year.Ravindra Jadeja: The India all-rounder is one of the main cogs in CSK’s wheel. His superb form with the bat in the last couple of years means he in all probability will get to bat in the top six for CSK this season. Of course, we can’t even dare to forget what he brings to the table as a left-arm spinner and as a fielder.Dwayne Bravo: The West Indian spent most of last season on the bench due to an injury and he would be raring to go this year. Back in the Windies fold as well, Bravo’s change of pace with the ball has been a big weapon. He continues to be one of the biggest match-winners in the shortest format.Piyush Chawla: An IPL veteran and one of the closest buddies of CSK captain Dhoni, Piyush Chawla has reached the twilight of his career. But CSK surprised everyone by picking him in the auctions held last year. Now with Harbhajan Singh not there, it will be Chawla who will lead the CSK’s spin attack.Deepak Chahar: There were doubts about his availability in the tournament opener when Chahar tested positive for Covid-19 last month. But in a big relief to CSK, the right-arm seamer tested negative last week and joined the practice with the rest of the squad members. He will lead CSK’s new-ball attack.Shardul Thakur: The Mumbai seamer has been a part of the CSK squad for some time. With all the knuckle balls, leg cutters and slower bouncers, he is certain to be a key weapon for CSK in the middle overs.Imran Tahir: The South African leg spinner picked up 26 wickets last season, which is the most for a spinner in a single IPL season. The leggie will be a big threat yet again on the slow and sluggish surface in Chennai. His partnership with Harbhajan Singh will be one to look out for yet again.
Both the indigenously developed vaccine candidates against the Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) have shown excellent safety profile, Union minister of state Ashwini Kumar Choubey said in a written reply in the Lok Sabha.However, Immunogenicity testing, to determine whether the vaccine provokes the body’s immune response, is still in progress, the minister added.Bharat Biotech International Ltd’s inactivated whole virus candidate vaccine (BBV152) for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, is developed using the virus isolate (NIV-2020-770) provided by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune.Characterization of the vaccine candidate has been undertaken at ICMR-NIV followed by safety and tolerability studies in small animals like rats, mice and rabbits.“Phase I clinical trials along with parallel studies in hamsters and rhesus macaques have been completed. The trial has revealed excellent safety of the candidate vaccine. Immunogenicity testing is in progress. Phase II clinical trials are ongoing,” said Choubey’s reply.Another make in India vaccine candidate by Cadila Health Ltd. is a DNA-based vaccine (ZyCov-D). Pre-clinical toxicity studies were conducted in small animals: mice, rats, rabbits and guinea pigs. The vaccine has been found to be safe and immunogenic. Cadila has partnered with ICMR to conduct parallel pre-clinical studies in rhesus macaques.Status of clinical trials for this vaccine candidate is the same as Bharat Biotech’s vaccine candidate, with Phase I clinical trials having been completed revealing excellent safety of the candidate vaccine. Immunogenicity testing is in progress, and phase II clinical trials are ongoing.Also, Serum Institute of India (SII) and ICMR have partnered for clinical development of two global vaccine candidates that are in different stages of trials.“ChAdOx1-S, which is a non- replicating viral vector vaccine, developed by University of Oxford-AstraZeneca, is undergoing phase III clinical trials in Brazil. Phase II/III bridging studies have been initiated by ICMR at 14 clinical trial sites. ICMR-National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis (NIRT), Chennai is the lead institution. ICMR and SII have also partnered for clinical development of a glycoprotein subunit nanoparticle adjuvanted vaccine developed by Novavax from USA. The trial will be initiated in the second half of October after the vaccine is manufactured by SII. The trial is led by ICMR-National AIDS Research Institute (NARI), Pune,” Choubey said.According to the department of biotechnology and department of science and technology, at least 30 vaccine candidates have been supported by the government that are currently in different stages of development.
The president of the European Commission urged EU members to build a stronger health union on Wednesday, promising a biomedical research agency and a global summit.In her first annual State of the European Union address, Ursula von der Leyen said the coronavirus pandemic had underlined the need for closer cooperation, stressing that people were “still suffering”.“For me, it is crystal clear -- we need to build a stronger European Health Union,” she said. “And we need to strengthen our crisis preparedness and management of cross-border health threats.”Addressing MEPs in the European Parliament, von der Leyen said her commission would try to reinforce the European Medicines Agency and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.And she announced the creation of a new agency for biomedical advanced research and development dubbed BARDA.She said she would work with Italy during its presidency of the G20 -- a grouping of the world’s richest countries -- to convene a global health summit next year to share the lessons of the coronavirus crisis.“This will show Europeans that our Union is there to protect all,” she said.Health policy remains the responsibility of EU member states and, while Brussels has tried to coordinate the bloc’s response to the epidemic, national lockdowns and border rules have varied widely.Von der Leyen, a doctor by training, also warned countries not to act selfishly when on vaccines, which are widely seen as the solution to end the crisis.“Vaccine nationalism puts lives at risk. Vaccine cooperation saves them,” she said.She also called for a reformed and strengthened World Health Organization “so that we can better prepare” for future pandemics.
Apple Inc on Tuesday introduced a new Apple Watch Series 6 that monitors blood oxygen and starts at $399, kicking off a fall product lineup for a holiday shopping season that will be unlike any other due to Covid-19.Apple is also introducing a low-cost Apple Watch SE starting at $279 that does not monitor blood oxygen saturation.Apple was expected to update several products including iPads and headphones at an event on Tuesday broadcast from its Cupertino, California, headquarters. Its biggest seller - the iPhone - is expected to be announced next month after executives have said its launch will be delayed by several weeks because of pandemic-related disruptions.Apple shares have soared this year even as the virus has crippled economies around the world, thanks in large part to booming sales of work-from-home items.Apple shares were up 2% on Tuesday after climbing more than 50% for the year, well ahead of the 23% gain for the Nasdaq. Even though Apple stock has fallen from a record high earlier this month, it remains near its $2 trillion stock market valuation.How the new products sell during the holiday shopping season in many markets will largely define how well Apple performs for its entire fiscal year, which started this month.Apple said the Series 6 watch’s new ability to monitor blood oxygen using infrared light should be used for fitness and wellness purposes. Doctors in India and other countries have used pulse oximeters to remotely check on Covid-19 patients and ensure their oxygen saturation level does not fall too low.A level between 95% and 97% is considered normal by the American Lung Association https://www.lung.org/media/press-releases/pulse-oximeter-Covid-19. Patients below 95% should call their doctor and those under 90% should go to the emergency room, health experts advise.Low oxygen levels are usually not the sole indicator of having Covid-19, the association said.The previous version of the Apple Watch can already take measurements similar to electrocardiogram.Apple’s Heart Study found that the watch could accurately detect atrial fibrillation, the most common type of irregular heartbeat, according to a study that explored the role of wearable devices in identifying potential heart problems. Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of stroke more than fivefold, according to the American Heart Association.Apple rival Fitbit Inc introduced a way to measure changes in blood oxygen earlier this year.

Billionaire Anil Agarwal-led Cairn India’s Rajasthan oil block licence extension is stuck in a dispute over cost and the firm is literally surviving on monthly extensions by the government, sources said.The government had in October 2018 agreed to extend by 10 years the contract for Barmer fields in Rajasthan after the expiry of the initial 25-year contract period on May 14, 2020. This extension was subject to Vedanta Group firm agreeing to raise the share of the government’s profit from oil and gas produced from the block by 10 per cent.While Cairn protested against the additional payout and took the government to court, the extension was subsequently held up due to the government claiming additional profit petroleum after re-allocating Rs 2,723 crore common cost between different fields in the block and disallowance of Rs 1,508 crore cost on a pipeline, sources privy to the development said.The government wants the company to clear the dues before the extension is granted, they said adding the company has disputed the demand and issued a notice of arbitration to resolve the differences.Pending resolution, the government first gave the company a three-month extension of the production sharing contract (PSC) for the Rajasthan block, which houses the prolific Mangla, Bhagyam and Aishwariya oilfields, till August 15, 2020.It subsequently extended the PSC by 15 days and then by a month till September 30, sources said.When contacted, a company spokesperson said, “The Rajasthan PSC allows extension on the same terms for a period of 10 years in case of commercial gas production and we are accordingly eligible for the extension.” The block, it said, produces more than 20 per cent of India’s crude oil production and has the potential to double this over the next 3 years.“This requires a reduction in fiscal levies and administrative support for timely approvals,” the spokesperson said. “We have referred a few matters to arbitration that we were not able to mutually resolve.” The company, however, refused to give details.“We are hopeful to see some positive outcomes, we are committed to produce in this block and contribute significantly towards a self-reliant economy,” the spokesperson added.Sources said the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), the upstream nodal authority of the Oil Ministry, on October 26, 2018, granted its approval for a ten-year extension of the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) for the Rajasthan Block (RJ), with effect from May 15, 2020 subject to payment of additional profit petroleum.Cairn challenged it before the Delhi High Court and the matter is sub-judice.The company also had a dispute with its partner state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) over investments made in the block, which held up the computation of the government’s share of profit petroleum for fiscal years ending March 31, 2019, and March 31, 2020.ONGC holds 30 per cent interest in the block while Cairn Oil & Gas, a unit of Vedanta Ltd, is the operator with a 70 per cent stake.Sources said DGH had way back in May 2018 raised a demand additional share of profit oil for the government after disallowing Rs 1,508 crore out of the cost incurred on laying a heated-pipeline to transport Barmer crude and Rs 2,723 crore in the reallocation of certain common costs.These costs pertain to only Cairn’s share in the Rajasthan block as ONGC has agreed to pay the government if these costs are disallowed.In all, Rs 4,828 crore, including interest, is being sought to be disallowed for the 2017-18 fiscal.The company believes that it has sufficient as well as a reasonable basis for having claimed such costs and for allocating common costs between different fields, sources said adding it believes that the conditions linked to PSC extension are untenable.
IPL team Delhi Capitals on Friday said its players will don jerseys bearing the message “Thank You COVID Warriors” during the entire tournament in UAE, calling the initiative a “small token of gratitude” towards the frontline workers fighting the pandemic.IPL starts on Saturday in Abu Dhabi withh defending champions Mumbai Indians taking on Chennai Super Kings in Abu Dhabi.“...the Delhi Capitals official match jersey will bear the ‘Thank You COVID Warrior’ message for the entire duration of this season,” the franchise said in a statement.Delhi Capitals’ senior India pacer Ishant Sharma, spinner Amit Mishra and assistant coach Mohammad Kaif interacted with a few frontline workers, including doctors and police officers, in a virtual meet apart from sending them personalised team jerseys under the ‘Salaam Dilli’ initiative.“To all the sanitation workers, doctors, security forces, blood donors, social workers, drivers, and their respective families - this small token of thanks from our team is testament of your service towards humanity,” Ishant was quoted as saying in the DC press release.The workers honoured by the franchise included those who distributed home-made masks for free, installed mask-vending machines in public places, donated personal savings to buy air tickets for migrant workers and ran a plasma donation network.Amit Mishra said, “Words are not enough to thank these COVID warriors. A big Salaam from all of us for you. As our world continues to battle and survive this pandemic, it’s efforts like yours that will continue to inspire, and make a difference.”Kaif added, “It takes real selflessness, humility and desire to be able to put others first in this battle for survival.

The US Commerce Department issued an order on Friday that will bar people in the United States from downloading Chinese-owned messaging app WeChat and video-sharing app TikTok starting on September 20.Commerce officials said the ban on new US downloads of TikTok could be still rescinded by President Donald Trump before it takes effect late Sunday as TikTok owner ByteDance races to clinch an agreement over the fate of its US operations.ByteDance has been talks with Oracle Corp and others to create a new company, TikTok Global, that aims to address US concerns about the security of its users’ data. ByteDance still needs Trump’s approval to stave off a US ban.Watch | TikTok, WeChat use to be banned in US from September 20: All you need to knowCommerce officials said they will not bar additional technical transactions for TikTok until Nov. 12, which gives the company additional time to see if ByteDance can reach a deal for its US operations. “The basic TikTok will stay intact until Nov. 12,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Fox Business Network.The department said the actions will “protect users in the US by eliminating access to these applications and significantly reducing their functionality.”Oracle shares fell 1.6% after the news in pre-market tradingThe Commerce Department order will “deplatform” the two apps in the United States and bar Apple Inc’s app store, Alphabet Inc’s Google Play and others from offering the apps on any platform “that can be reached from within the United States,” a senior Commerce official told Reuters.The order will not ban US companies from doing businesses on WeChat outside the United States, which will be welcome news to US firms like Walmart and Starbucks that use WeChat’s embedded ‘mini-app’ programs to facilitate transactions and engage consumers in China, officials said.The order will not bar transactions with WeChat-owner Tencent Holdings’ other businesses, including its online gaming operations, and will not prohibit Apple, Google or others from offering TikTok or WeChat apps anywhere outside the United States.The bans are in response to a pair of executive orders issued by Trump on August 6 that gave the Commerce Department 45 days to determine what transactions to block from the apps he deemed pose a national security threat. That deadline expires on Sunday.Commerce Department officials said they were taking the extraordinary step because of the risks the apps’ data collection poses. China and the companies have denied US user data is collected for spying.Ross said in a written statement “we have taken significant action to combat China’s malicious collection of American citizens’ personal data, while promoting our national values, democratic rules-based norms, and aggressive enforcement of US laws and regulations.”The order is set to be published at 8:45 a.m. EDT (1245 GMT) on Friday, Commerce said.Popular appsThe Trump administration has ramped up efforts to purge “untrusted” Chinese apps from US digital networks and has called TikTok and WeChat “significant threats.”TikTok has 100 million users in the United States and is especially popular among younger Americans.WeChat has had an average of 19 million daily active users in the United States, analytics firms Apptopia said in early August. It is popular among Chinese students, ex-pats and some Americans who have personal or business relationships in China.WeChat is an all-in-one mobile app that combines services similar to Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Venmo. The app is an essential part of daily life for many in China and boasts more than 1 billion users.The Commerce Department will not seek to compel people in the United States to remove the apps or stop using them but will not allow updates or new downloads. “We are aiming at a top corporate level. We’re not going to go out after the individual users,” one Commerce official said.Over time, officials said, the lack of updates will degrade the apps usability.“The expectation is that people will find alternative ways to do these actions,” a senior official said. “We expect the market to act and there will be more secure apps that will fill in these gaps that Americans can trust and that the United States government won’t have to take similar actions against.”Commerce is also barring additional technical transactions with WeChat starting Sunday that will significantly reduce the usability and functionality of the app in the United States.The order bars data hosting within the United States for WeChat, content delivery services and networks that can increase functionality and internet transit or peering services.“What immediately is going to happen is users are going to experience a lag or lack of functionality,” a senior Commerce official said of WeChat users. “It may still be usable but it is not going to be as functional as it was.” There may be sporadic outages as well, the official said.Commerce will bar the same set of technical transactions for TikTok, but that will not take effect until Nov. 12 to give the company additional time to see if ByteDance can reach a deal for its US operations. The official said TikTok US users would not see “a major difference” in the app’s performance until Nov. 12.Commerce will not penalize people who use TikTok or WeChat in the United States.The order does not bar data storage within the United States for WeChat or TikTok.Some Americans may find workarounds. There is nothing that would bar an American from traveling to a foreign country and downloading either app, or potentially using a virtual private network and a desktop client, officials conceded.
In a swift operation, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) raided a migrant workers’ settlement in Kochi in the early hours of Saturday and arrested three alleged al-Qaeda operatives who were planning a series of terror attacks.The NIA said the terror module was operational for some time and they were planning a series of attacks in major cities including Delhi, Mumbai and Kochi. It said raids were carried out at the same time in Kerala and West Bengal-- six people were arrested from Murshidabad also. Kerala police chief Loknath Behra said the state police was informed and they helped the premier agency in the raid.All three arrested in Kochi-- Murshid Hasan, Iyakub Biswas and Mosaraf Hossen-- hailed from West Bengal and they were discreetly staying as migrant workers. They were staying separately to avoid detection but they were in constant touch, NIA officials said. Some of the workers staying with them told the NIA that they never had any idea about their dubious activities but they were very religious and always hooked to their phones. But the NIA suspects that they might have got local support.Hasan is reported to be the leader of Kerala module and they were planning lone wolf attacks and suicide bombings. They also planned to target vital installations like southern naval command and Cochin Shipyard, officials said.Though in Kerala many Islamic State sympathisers were arrested earlier, this is the first time an al-Qaeda module has been busted. According to officers investigating the case, those arrested were radicalised by al-Qaeda leaders in Pakistan and they were in touch with some of them through encrypted Telegram app. Some of the workers told investigators that they were not regular at construction sites and they spent enough time on their phones. A laptop, terror leaflets and bomb-making materials were seized from their hideouts.One of them, Murshid Hasan, was staying in the state for more than five years and another Biswas had worked in a tea shop in Idukki for eight months before shifting his base to Kochi. “They led a normal life and produced all papers before their stay. One of them was staying with his family. We are really shocked to hear their terror-related activities,” one of the locals said adding Kochi will have to be on high alert as around five lakh migrant workers are working in the city and outskirts.Kerala police also suspect that some local people might have extended help to them. “We are keeping a close vigil on all migrant camps and employers have been instructed to keep personal details of all employees,” said a senior police officer.In 2016, at least 21 people from the state had slipped out of the country to join the Islamic State and most of them have reportedly died in Afghanistan and Iraq. Some of their widows and children are reportedly lodged in prisons in Afghanistan.
Showbiz is undergoing an evolution, says actor Sharad Malhotra, who believes that the coming time is good for talent to survive and if one has it in them to engage the audience, they’re here to stay.“Only talent will flourish now. It won’t matter whether you are related to an actor, director or producer. There won’t be any insider or outsider any more. The industry is on a restructure mode, number game giving way to capability. If you can surprise the audience, perform with honesty, you’re here to stay. If you don’t interest the audience, they would switch to the next channel, web show or another film,” he explains.Known for TV shows such as Banoo Main Teri Dulhann, Bharat Ka Veer Putra – Maharana Pratap, Kasam Tere Pyaar Ki and Muskaan, the actor feels the level playing ground is in the making.“Now there will be equal opportunities for everyone,” he adds.Apart from doing TV, Malhotra had done two Bollywood films, From Sydney with Love (2012) and Ek Tera Saath (2016), and both failed to make a mark.“The films not working out was upsetting, but I knew that I’ll take the plunge when the time is right. With the outsider and insider divide diminishing, I would like to explore Bollywood again now,” says the actor, adding that he’s interested in exploring the web space, too.With a career spanning over 15 years, Malhotra says his efforts have always been to get identified for his performances.“Even on TV, they know I’d ask questions, take time to work on my characters and would be able to deliver. I’ll follow same procedure wherever I go. And much like TV, I’d like to do pivotal parts in films or characters that have the ability to change the narrative irrespective of the screen time. Interesting content is my focus, regular is boring,” he shares.But before you draw conclusions, he clarifies, “TV is my bread, butter and jam. I identify with the medium, it’s my first love. It’s only in India TV is looked down upon. Look at the west. Film and theatres actors do TV. Closer home too many film actors are doing TV. Films are being promoted in TV shows, why because TV has that reach and acceptance. TV is churning good content. You need to respect a medium to understand the good it offers. In fact the crossover of talents between OTT, films and TV that has started happening is actually making things democratic.”Author tweets @Shreya_MJ
A poll of Indian Americans has found that 66% of respondents favour Democrat Joe Biden for the presidential election in November, while President Donald Trump trails way behind at 28%.But Trump has made considerable headway, coming up from 16% in 2016, according to the Indiaspora-AAPI Data survey released on Tuesday.The poll also affirmed the growing clout of the Indian American community’s 1.8 million registered voters — 56% of them reported being contacted by Democrats and 48% by Republicans, compared to only 31% reached by any party in 2016.As a community with the highest earnings, Indian Americans are also “flexing their financial muscle” as the survey put it . A quarter of those polled said they had made donations to a candidate, political party or some other campaign body this year; $3 million anecdotally, with double-digit aspirations.A majority of Indian Americans, 54%, identified themselves Democrats while the second biggest group of 24% identified themselves as Independents and only 16% called themselves Republican, compared to 45%, 35% and 19% respectively in 2016.The most significant shift, or the beginning of it, was reflected in the numbers for the race for the White House. While Indian Americans’ support for Biden was an overwhelming at 66%, it was far lower than the 77% support for Hillary Clinton, then Democratic nominee, in 2016, and the brutal 84% that President Barak Obama got in the 2012 election.Trump, on the other hand, has gone up from 12% in 2016 to 28% , and could go up to 30% if he and Biden split up the 6% undecided respondents proportional to their current tallies.That should worry Democrats. “The Biden campaign has to be especially attentive” and should conduct a vigorous outreach to the community, said Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi. Eventually, he added, these voters will “come home” to the Democratic Party because of their concerns about other issues, specially Covid-19.Neeraj Antani, a Republican member of the Ohio state legislature, attributed Trump’s expanding support among Indian Americans to the president’s outreach to the community, his visit to India in February and for standing with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and neutrality on issues like Citizenship Amendment Act and the abrogation of Article 370 on the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, as opposed to Biden’s opposition to those issues.Biden campaign’s position on Article 370 and the CAA has indeed antagonised a section of Indian Americans and has led to talk that a Biden administration will be less friendly to India.The former vice-president has sought to address those concerns and assured the community that relations with India will be a “high priority” for his administration if elected. He promised that his administration will also prevent China from acting with “impunity” and show no tolerance for cross-border terrorism, putting Pakistan on notice. He also rolled out an expansive plan for Indian Americans, focusing on hate crimes and immigration.As part of its outreach to the community, the Trump campaign has released a video of clip from Howdy Modi and Namaste Trump events the president attended with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the US and India respectively, highlighting their relationship and support of the cheering crowds.The community is being wooed aggressively by both parties, as the survey findings showed — 56% reported being contacted by Democrats and 58% by Republicans compared to merely 31% by any party in 2016, far below then 44% for white voters and 42% for white voters.The reasons fairly simple. Trump won the 2016 election with narrow victory margins in key battleground states, which he can hold on to with the support of Indian Americans, or lose them if Democrats are able to persuade the community to vote for Biden, and in larger numbers.Indian Americans have the numbers that both Biden and Trump would want in these states. “Indian Americans are positioned to make a difference in several swing states that may be close in this election, such as Florida ( 87,000 ), Pennsylvania (61,000), Georgia (57,000), Michigan (45,000), and North Carolina (36,000), and perhaps even Texas, which has 160,000 Indian-American voters,” said Karthick Ramakrishnan, professor of public policy and political science at UC Riverside, and founder of AAPI Data.He added that a high turnout driven by Senator Kamala Harris’s “historic vice-presidential nomination” and the “highly publicised” Houston and Ahmedabad rallies that Trump and Modi held together “could make a huge difference in this election”.M R Rangaswami, founder of Indiaspora, said, “Given the Indian diaspora’s increasing political importance in the US, it’s no surprise they are being courted by both sides of the aisle.”He added: “It’s great that both major political parties have begun to realise just how critical it is to reach out to Indian Americans – our impact is only going to increase over time.”
In August of 1997, former India left-arm spinner Nilesh Kulkarni made history when he became the first Indian to get a wicket off his first ball in Test cricket. Kulkarni made his Test debut in the first match of the series at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo, and got the wicket of Marvan Atapattu first ball.It was the same match which became famous for the highest Test innings score of 952/6 declared, which Sri Lanka piled batting second. But outside of Sanath Jayasuriya (340) and Roshan Mahanama notching up their career-best Test scores, Kulkarni tasted a slice of history too. Looking back at the moment, Kulkarni recalled the wicket, saying it all happened in a blink of an eye and how it was after the end of the day’s play that he was made aware of his record.“After Sachin (Tendulkar) declared in the last session of Day Two, the Sri Lankans began well. In fact, I was not supposed to bowl on that day. Usually, the captain lets you know in advance so that you start warming up and I had not got any indication. So, I was casually moving from my fielding position. As luck would have it, suddenly Sachin came and told, ‘Nilesh come and bowl.’ This was probably because Marvan (a right-hander) was on strike. As I was getting to the umpire, he told me to start the over within a minute otherwise it will be the end of the day,” Kulkarni told cricket.com.“So, then I went through all my motions very quickly without having the time to prepare. My only focus was to land the ball in the right place so that I should not look like an idiot in my debut ball. Thankfully, it did, Marvan nicked it and Nayan Mongia took a brilliant catch. It became a great story for me. To be honest, I did not know about the record and was only happy that I got a wicket. After the day’s play, I was in the nets preparing for the next day. Then all the Indian journalists started congratulating me and said that it is part of a record. That’s when it hit me. It was a very satisfying moment.”Kulkarni went on to play two more Tests for India, one later that year at Nagpur, and his final game four years later, which was the third and final Test of the famous 2001 Border-Gavaskar Trophy. He picked up the wicket of opener Matthew Hayden in the second innings of the Test but it was his batting that Kulkarni was more worried about.With the Test match going down to the wire and India eight wickets down, Kulkarni was the final batsman padded up. Thankfully for Kulkarni, his turn never came but till the time the winning runs weren’t scored, the former spinner was a nervous wreck.“Well, I was sitting on a pressure cooker. Every senior member would just come and say that I had to hang around like I had done in the first innings. At that point of time, my weight was around 80 Kgs, but with the pressure, I felt as though it was 240 Kgs (laughs). In those days, the dressing room in Chennai just had an open barricading between the crowd and the pavilion,” Kulkarni said.“A couple of guys just started shouting to not repeat the 1986 tied Test (when the last man dismissed was also a left-arm spinner, Maninder Singh) and said ‘Nilesh you have to do it.’ All those thoughts started hitting me. But the brilliant effort of Sameer Dighe and Harbhajan Singh ensured that I didn’t have to go out to bat.”
India on Saturday added 93,337 fresh cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), pushing the cumulative tally past 5.3 million mark as the nation continued its standing as the second worst-hit by the pandemic globally.

Taking on critics, Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday said a “simple woman finance minister saying Act of God is taken sarcastically” while latin word ‘force majeure’ is well accepted.Speaking in Lok Sabha, Sitharaman -- who is also the country’s first woman finance minister -- said her remark is being criticised also because she “looks like a neighbourhood aunty” and asserted that twisting her comment is irresponsible.On August 27, she said the economy has been hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, which is an ‘Act of God’, and it will see a contraction in the current fiscal. Her comment has been criticised by various political parties.“Many people spoke on GST compensation issue (and) my statement of Act of God was referred several times. I happy for that. People like using latin expression of force majeure, for expressing extraordinary situation. But simple woman finance minister saying Act of God is taken sarcastically. What is this sir?,” she said while replying to the debate on the first batch of supplementary demands for grants for 2020-21.Noting that force majeure in the court for clients is very well but not “Act of God”, she said, “because this woman, who is minister, looks like neighbourhood aunty. So, how can she ever say this”.“I like this condescension,” she said in an apparent dig at the Opposition.Defending her remark on GST compensation to the states, Sitharaman said that to twist what she has said to “say the Centre is reneging its responsibility is absolutely irresponsible comment towards a responsible government which is being led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi”.“I am ready to listen your suggestions but not sarcasm. Tell me one state government, which can tell me, no no we will manage it (current situation due to COVID-19),” she said.Referring to the current tensions between India and China at eastern Ladakh, the finance minister said that she does not want to speak in detail about the national security issue but despite the Ladakh situation, the government is not cutting down on devolution of taxes to the states.
According to reports about Unlock 4.0, the Centre is unlikely to allow the reopening of schools. Covid-19 has had a catastrophic effect on the education systems across the world. According to a United Nations (UN) report, the closure of schools has affected 94% of the world’s student population and up to 99% students in low and lower-middle-income countries. The pandemic has exacerbated the existing challenge for India — of weak learning outcomes, especially in government and low-fee private schools.There is, however, some good news. To ensure learning continuity during the pandemic, many government school teachers have come up with innovative and low-cost ideas. In Jharkhand, a teacher has put up loudspeakers so that children can learn sitting outside their homes. In rural Sikkim, a teacher visits her students one by one and takes impromptu classes. In Karnataka, many teachers are using community and open spaces for teaching. In Chhattisgarh, they are using loudspeakers to teach English through Halbi, the tribal language.Government schools teachers — who are often asked to do several non-teaching jobs and don’t get adequate in-service training (leave alone online training) — are censured for being ineffective and apathetic. But Covid-19 shows that some are just the opposite; they can innovate. The efforts of these teachers should be acknowledged and shared among their peer groups, innovative steps fine-tuned, formalised, and scaled-up as both responses to sudden disruptions and as an alternative to online learning till the digital divide is truly bridged.
India’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations TS Tirumurti on Friday (local time) said the highlight of the “historic” UN General Assembly session this year will be the participation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in two debates in the high-level segments beginning from September 21.“This time, the UN General Assembly will be historic and in more than one way. As far as India is concerned, the highlight will be the participation of PM Modi in two debates in the high-level segments starting on Monday,” Tirumuti told ANI in an exclusive interview.He said the first event is a general debate where the Prime Minister will represent India at the UN and deliver the national statement while the other is the high-level plenary meeting to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the UN. “His address will certainly be the highlight of our participation in UNGA,” Tirumurti remarked.The diplomat informed that a biodiversity summit will be organised virtually on September 30 with the theme -- ‘Urgent action on biodiversity for sustainable development’. “This will be the first summit on biodiversity in the UN. Our Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar will be participating in this summit,” he said.Tirumurti stressed that India is one of 10 mega biodiverse countries in the world and the country has taken a leading role in the field of biodiversity.“India recently held the Conference of Parties of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals in February this year. We had also organised the Conference of Parties to the UN Convention to Combat Desertification in September last year in Delhi, which saw the adoption of the ambitious Delhi Declaration,” he said.He also informed that an important event to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the World Conference on Women will be held on October 1 and the adoption of the Beijing Platform for action, which is “widely acknowledged as the most comprehensive plan for advancing rights of women and girls”.The event will be attended by Women and Child Development Minister Smriti Irani, underlining India’s strong commitment to women empowerment and gender sensitivity.Furthermore, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar will be participating in some of the ministerial meetings which will be held on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, said Tirumurti.“On October 2, the UN will be holding International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons. Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla will be delivering India’s remarks at this event,” he further informed.Tirumurti said the theme of the current UN General Assembly session is -- ‘The Future We Want, The UN We Need’, “reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism, confronting Covid-19 through effective multilateral actions”.He also said the UN General Assembly session will be different this year from all previous seasons as the world is still in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic. “We hope that member states take Covid-19 as an opportunity to opt for reforms and change in order to have the future we want.”The diplomat stated that in view of the Covid-19 travel restrictions, most leaders will not travel to New York and the high-level debate will be conducted virtually.“World leaders will be delivering their national statements through pre-recorded videos. The hall of the General Assembly will not be empty. One representative per delegation will be allowed in the General Assembly hall. If they wish, they can introduce the video of their respective heads of state or government,” Tirumurti said.

From capturing global strategic imagination with his “Confluence of the Two Seas” speech in the Indian Parliament to articulating the India-Japan Indo-Pacific Vision 2025 — the Shinzo Abe era is defined by high-powered diplomacy that delivered.As the challenges to the liberal order grew, India and Japan turned their geopolitical and geo-economic concerns into concerted actions. They advanced issue-based alignments, be it defending the rules-based order through Japan-United States (US)-India (JAI) and Quad or designing the Australia-India-Japan Supply Chain Resilience Initiative.China’s rise, alliance politics and hedging against American abandonment shaped Tokyo’s policy discourse. Abe’s strategic calculations manifested internal and external balancing. He rewired Japan’s post-war security posture, reinforced the US-Japan alliance, and wove a network of strategic partnerships across Indo-Pacific.Abe envisaged Tokyo’s role in the international system as a stabiliser and a rules-promoter. His Indo-Pacific Vision remained anchored on rule of law, freedom of navigation and over flight, trade liberalisation, and multilateralism.As Japan conceptualised universal value- based strategic designs, India has been accorded primacy in the Arc of Freedom and Prosperity, Asia’s Democratic Security Diamond, and the Free and Open Indo-Pacific.Abe’s strategic imagination was complemented by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Act East policy. Mutuality of values and convergence of strategic interests added qualitative depth. Much of the dynamism draws from the personal comradery between the two leaders. The high-resolution optics — from shinkansen ride to Kobe and private dinner at Yamanashi home, Ganga aarti at Dashashwamedh Ghat and road show to Sabarmati Ashram — Abe has left a deep impression in Indian public memory.The leaders pushed for collective responsibility in securing the global maritime commons. Firming up maritime security cooperation with humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations, advancing maritime domain awareness, finalising reciprocal support concerning logistics, supplies, and services through Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA), and augmenting interoperability within Indo-Pacific navies through Malabar exercises enabled greater leeway in managing a range of shared challenges.The Abe era also played an instrumental role in enabling India’s economic modernisation. Tokyo is not just a leading source of Official Development Assistance (ODA), but also a top source of foreign direct investment. From mega industrial corridors, high- speed rail and modernising urban rapid transport system, Japanese development assistance has been an enabler. But it is not just mega projects in economic epicentres, Abe has successfully steered development assistance in strategic peripheries, including the Northeast and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Japan’s commitment to the Northeast is projected through the upcoming industrial township in Assam to road connectivity projects that advances quality infrastructure and links the Northeast to the regional value chains and markets of Southeast Asia.Abe drove infrastructure financing to engineer new frontiers of growth by seizing the international infrastructure market and buttressing strategic partnerships across Southeast and South Asia. Abe designed Japan’s Expanded Partnership for Quality Infrastructure initiative, which served as a win-win formulation for Delhi as it intersected with the Make in India initiative. Fostering economic linkages, industrial networks and connectivity by employing collective capabilities with other like-minded countries has led to joint projects in a few Bay of Bengal states.In navigating the geopolitics of Indo-Pacific, India-Japan prioritised the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) centrality and coordinated strategic agendas in the Asean-led multilateral frameworks. In shaping geo-economics, the Abe administration favoured India’s membership in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), even though India has had unresolved outstanding issues.But there have been some misses as well. Trade balance and progress in high-technology trade needs more attention. As Abe eased Japan’s arms export policy, the latitude for defence technology cooperation has been redefined.Key policy documents and business lobbies in Japan have prioritised markets such as India, but trade in defence technology is a relatively new domain. While cooperative research on Unmanned Ground Vehicle/robotics have been undertaken, concluding the maiden G2G defence equipment cooperation has proved challenging.As Delhi gears up for a post-Abe leadership, India’s ascendency in Japan’s strategic frame will endure and outlive the Abe administration. This is primarily because the variables that pushed Tokyo to incorporate Delhi in its Indo-Pacific matrix will perhaps become even more urgent, given the geopolitics and geo-economics of the post-Covid-19 world.Titli Basu is associate fellow, Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and AnalysesThe views expressed are personal
A House committee issued a scathing report Wednesday questioning whether Boeing and government regulators have recognized problems that caused two deadly 737 Max jet crashes and whether either will be willing to make significant changes to fix them.Staff members from the Democrat-controlled Transportation Committee blamed the crashes that killed 346 people on the “horrific culmination” of failed government oversight, design flaws and a lack of action at Boeing despite knowing about problems.The committee identified deficiencies in the Federal Aviation Administration approval process for new jetliners. But the agency and Boeing have said certification of the Max complied with FAA regulations, the 246-page report said.“The fact that a compliant airplane suffered from two deadly crashes in less than five months is clear evidence that the current regulatory system is fundamentally flawed and needs to be repaired,” the staff wrote in the report released early Wednesday.The report highlights the need for legislation to fix the approval process and deal with the FAA’s delegation of some oversight tasks to aircraft manufacturer employees, said Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio, D-Oregon.“Obviously the system is inadequate,” DeFazio said. “We will be adopting significant reforms.”He wouldn’t give details, saying committee leaders are in talks with Republicans about legislation. He said the committee won’t scrap the delegation program, and he hopes to reach agreement on reforms before year’s end.A Senate committee on Wednesday could make changes to a bipartisan bill giving the FAA more control over picking company employees who sign off on safety decisions. One improvement may be that a plane with significant changes from previous models would need more FAA review.The House report stems from an 18-month investigation into the October 2018 crash of Lion Air flight 610 in Indonesia and the crash of Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 in March of 2019. The Max was grounded worldwide shortly after the Ethiopia crash. Regulators are testing planes with revamped flight control software, and Boeing hopes to get the Max flying again late this year or early in 2021.Relatives of people who died in the crashes said the report exposes the truth.“It was an unforgivable crime, and Boeing still wants to return the aircraft to service quickly,” said Ababu Amha, whose wife was a flight attendant on the Ethiopia Airlines jet. “All those responsible for the accident should pay the price for their actions.”Paul Njoroge of Toronto, whose wife, three young children and mother-in-law died in the Ethiopia crash while traveling to Kenya to see grandparents, said the report revealed Boeing’s culture of putting profit ahead of safety.“There are instances in the report where some employees within Boeing tried to raise safety concern issues. But their concerns would be slammed by people within Boeing,” said Njoroge, who is among those suing the company. “This is an organization that should focus more on delivering safe planes.”Eighteen months after the crash, Njoroge said he still relies on support from others. “It just doesn’t go away. It never leaves my mind,” he said.The investigators mainly focused on the reason Boeing was able to get the jet approved with minimal pilot training: It convinced the FAA that the Max was an updated version of previous generation 737s.But in fact, Boeing equipped the plane with software called MCAS, an acronym for Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, which automatically lowers the plane’s nose to prevent an aerodynamic stall. Initially, pilots worldwide weren’t told about the system, which Boeing said was needed because the Max had bigger, more powerful engines that were placed further forward on the wings than older 737s and tended to push the nose up.In both crashes, MCAS repeatedly pointed the nose down, forcing pilots into unsuccessful struggles to keep the planes aloft.Investigators said they found several instances in which Boeing concealed information about MCAS from the FAA and airlines.The Chicago-based company didn’t disclose that MCAS worked off a single sensor that measures a plane’s pitch. It also didn’t disclose that a gauge that would have alerted pilots to a malfunctioning sensor didn’t work on most of the jets.Boeing also concealed that it took a company test pilot over 10 seconds to determine that MCAS was operating and respond to it, a condition that the pilot found to be “catastrophic,” according to the report. Federal guidelines assume pilots will respond to this condition within four seconds.Four Boeing employees working as “authorized representatives” with permission to act on the FAA’s behalf to validate aircraft systems knew about the pilot’s slow response. But there was no evidence that they reported this to the FAA, the report said.Another authorized representative raised concerns in 2016 about hazards of MCAS repeatedly pointing the plane’s nose down, but those never made it to the FAA.According to the report, Boeing wanted to keep details about MCAS from the FAA so it wouldn’t require additional pilot training. That would ruin Boeing’s sales pitch for the Max, that pilots of older 737s wouldn’t need extensive simulator training to fly the new planes.Investigators found that under a 2011 contract with Southwest Airlines, Boeing would have had to knock $1 million off the price of each Max if simulator training was added.“That drove a whole lot of really bad decisions internally at Boeing, and also the FAA did not pick up on these things,” DeFazio said.He added that Boeing had an internal meeting in 2013 and agreed never to talk about MCAS outside the company. At one point, MCAS was listed in pilot training manuals, but an authorized representative approved its removal, he said.In a statement, Boeing said it has worked to strengthen its safety culture and has learned from mistakes. The company said it has has incorporated many recommendations from committees and experts who have examined Max issues.“Change is always hard and requires a daily commitment, but we as a company are dedicated to doing the work,” the statement said.The FAA said it looks forward to making improvements, and changes already are being made based on internal and independent reviews.“These initiatives are focused on advancing overall aviation safety by improving our organization, processes, and culture,” the FAA said, adding that it is requiring a number of Max design changes before it can fly again.When it came to FAA oversight, investigators said they found multiple examples of agency managers overruling technical and safety experts at Boeing’s behest. A draft internal FAA safety culture survey said that many in the FAA believe leaders “are overly concerned with achieving the business oriented outcomes of industry stakeholders and are not held accountable for safety-related decisions,” the report stated.In an interview with investigators, Keith Leverkuhn, former Boeing general manager for the Max who was promoted in the company, said he considered development of the Max a success despite the crashes.“I do challenge the suggestion that the development was a failure,” the report quotes him as saying.Investigators wrote that this raised doubts about Boeing’s ability to change.“Only a genuine, holistic, and assertive commitment to changing the cultural issues unearthed in the committee’s investigation ... can enhance aviation safety and truly help both Boeing and the FAA learn from the dire lessons of the 737 Max tragedies,” the report said.

The Delhi police on Saturday said that journalist Rajeev Sharma,61, arrested on charges of spying five days ago, allegedly passed on “sensitive and classified” information to Chinese intelligence agencies since 2016 and has been paid nearly Rs 40 lakh through various channels including hawala transactions and shell companies. Police said a 30-year-old Chinese woman, Qing Shi, and a Nepalese man, Sher Singh alias Raj Bohra, 30, have been arrested and booked along with Sharma under the Official Secrets Act.Sanjeev Yadav, the deputy commissioner of police (special cell), said Sharma was allegedly in contact with a Chinese intelligence official whom the police only identified as Michael, and, since 2019, with another Chinese person identified as George . He sent Michael classified information related to Indian army deployment in the China-Bhutan-India tri-junction, including Doklam.DCP Yadav said that the 2017 Doklam standoff happened just a few weeks after Sharma shared some classified information regarding India’s position, procurement and strategies on the border. Police said Sharma had also passed on information related to India’s military cooperation with Myanmar and other details about the border between India and China. According to investigating officials, Sharma has a Press Information Bureau (PIB) identity card, which he used to visit different government offices and get information from his contacts. The PIB card was issued in the mid-80s, when he was working with United News Agency and was valid till December 31, 2020. The police said that Sharma has told them that he visited the defence and external Affairs ministries to gather information to write his columns, he also took help from other journalists in getting details, by claiming that he wanted the information for his columns.Sharma’s columns appeared in Mail Today, a newspaper from the India Today group, until June 7 this year, before it was shut down. The paper’s former editor, Dwaipayan Bose, said, “Since the case is being investigated we feel that to comment now is inappropriate.”Specifics of the information collected and passed on by Sharma are not known. Nor is it clear how he came by classified information. The police said nothing about his contacts in the ministries.HT learns that Sharma may have been caught on the basis of communication intercepts by intelligence agencies, but could not confirm this. Yadav admitted that Sharma’s arrest came after police received inputs from a central intelligence agency.Sharma’s lawyer, senior advocate Adishi Aggarwala, denied the allegations. “As per the statement of the wife of my client (Sharma), the police did not recover any “classified and sensitive” documents from their home. She has told me that the police seized his laptop, mobile phone, bank statement, passport, income tax-related files, insurance documents , and other such documents. He had been writing articles, columns as a freelance journalist and was being paid for them, which is the job and right of any journalist. The charges against my client are false and he is innocent,” Aggarwala said.Police said the investigation has revealed that the two other people arrested, Qing and Singh were the directors of two shells companies, MZ Pharmacy and MZ Malls , in Delhi’s Mahipalpur that were floated exclusively for the purpose of bringing money in from China and transferring it to Sharma in cash fin return for the information. The shell companies were set up in 2013 by Chinese nationals Jhang Chang and his wife Chang-li-lia, who, according to the police, identified themselves as Indian citizens Suraj and Usha.Police said that at least three persons, including another freelance journalist, are being examined in the case . They did not identify these people.DCP Yadav said that between 2010 and 2014 Sharma wrote columns for Global Times, a Chinese daily that is widely considered a mouthpiece for the Chinese government.“Observing his columns, he was first contacted by a Chinese Intelligence officer, Michael, from Kunming city of China in 2016 through LinkedIn. Michael invited Sharma to Kunming City for an interview in a Chinese media company. His entire trip was funded by Michael. In the interview, he was told to pass on information on various aspects of India-China relations and assured money in return,” the officer said.Sharma remained in contact with Michael and his junior Xou, since 2016 and passed on to them classified information related to Indian army deployments in the China-Bhutan-India tri-junction. DCP Yadav said Sharma met with Chinese intelligence officials in China, Laos and Maldives.Yadav said that between 2016 and 2018, Sharma was in contact with Michael and Xou. The information were sent in “pointer format” through emails, and mobile applications such as Telegram and WhatsApp.HT visited Sharma’s residence in Pitampura on Saturday but his house was locked. Neighbours said that on the night of September 13, at around 11.00 pm, police raided his house. A security guard who was on duty that night said, “At around 11 pm a group of men in a car ordered my colleague to open the society gates. As soon as the gate was opened, about seven-eight cars zoomed into the colony. Soon, about 30-35 men, all in plainclothes, surrounded Sharma’s house (on the ground floor) They left at around 2.30 am.”Detailing Sharma’s alleged role after 2018, the special cell officer said, “In January 2019, Sharma came in contact with another Kunming-based Chinese person named George. He visited Kunming via Kathmandu and met George. George was introduced as a general manager of a Chinese Media Company. During the meeting, George asked Sharma to write and keep them informed about issues related to the Dalai Lama. For this, he was offered $500 per article. George told Sharma that they would send him money through a company operated by Qing.”Before returning to China in 2018, the Chinese couple (Jhang Chang and his wife Chang-li-lia) made Qing Shi and Nepalase citizen Sher Singh alias Raj Bohra the directors of the two shell companies. Singh used to work as the couple’s driver, Yadav said.Police said Qing Shi came to India in 2013 on a student visa and completed a nursing course from Jamia Millia Islamia. She is in India on a business visa.The have also found that around Rs 500000 was transferred into the account of Sharma’s neighbour at Sharma’s behest.“We questioned the neighbour, who is a prime witness in the case. The neighbour said that Sharma took his bank details for getting a money transfer. The money came into the account through multiple channels involving at least three different countries and some states in India,” added DCP Yadav.Neighbours, who did not wish to be identified, said Sharma lives with his wife, an associate professor in the department of physics at a Delhi university college. The couple has been living in the colony for the last 20 years. Their son, an MBA, works in the US, police said.In his Linkedin bio, Sharma has identified himself as a strategic analyst, political commentator, and maker of short films. He mentions he is a Masters in English Literature from Delhi university in 1981 and has been a journalist since 1982. He claims to have worked in various capacities such as correspondent, diplomatic correspondent and diplomatic associate editor with Tribune, Sakal Times and Eenadu Newstime.Press Club of India President Anand K Sahay issued a statement describing Sharma as an “independent journalist of long-standing” and describing his arrest by the police as “high handed” and “inspired by obscure and questionable considerations.”Sharma’s last post on Twitter (his account is currently suspended) on the day of his arrest read: “ Despite the five point peace reached between India and China in Moscow last week, China can still do mischief and the only mantra for lndia in dealing with Chinese must be: distrust and verify”
Congress leader Rahul Gandhi wished students appearing for the medical entrance exam NEET on Sunday, while expressing his sympathies with those who could not take it due to the COVID-19 pandemic and floods.He also criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying he wished the PM was concerned about the JEE-NEET aspirants.My best wishes to the students appearing for NEET exam and my sympathies to those who couldn’t take it due to the Covid pandemic and floods.Wish Modi ji was as concerned about JEE-NEET aspirants & students as he is about his crony capitalist friends. — Rahul Gandhi (@RahulGandhi) September 13, 2020“My best wishes to the students appearing for NEET exam and my sympathies to those who couldn’t take it due to the Covid pandemic and floods.Wish Modi ji was as concerned about JEE-NEET aspirants and students as he is about his crony capitalist friends,” he said on Twitter.Gandhi and his Congress party have been demanding postponement of NEET and JEE exams, saying the situation is not conducive for holding these exams due to the pandemic. He has also said holding the exams at such a time is endangering their lives.Over 15 lakh candidates are likely to appear in NEET on Sunday which will be conducted amid strict precautions in view of the COVID1-9 pandemic.The National Testing Agency (NTA), which is conducting the exam, said in order to maintain social distancing, it has increased the number of exam centres from originally-planned 2,546 to 3,843, while the number of candidates per room has been reduced from earlier 24 to 12.The crucial National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET), which is a pen and paper based test unlike the engineering entrance exam JEE, has already been deferred twice in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. The exam was originally scheduled for May 3, but was pushed to July 26, and then to September 13.A total of 15.97 lakh candidates have registered for the exam.
West London suburbs such as Southall, Hounslow, Slough and Hillingdon with large population of Indian origin people face the prospect of becoming ‘ghost towns’ due to the coronavirus pandemic severely impacting the Heathrow airport and the aviation industry, MPs and industry leaders say.Senior Labour MP Virendra Sharma (Ealing Southall) agreed on Thursday with Heathrow chief executive John Holland-Kaye that areas around the airport risk the fate of mining towns in north England that saw much poverty and deprivation when the coal industry was largely shut down by the Margaret Thatcher government amidst strikes in the 1980s.He said: “Areas around Heathrow will become ghost towns if no urgent measures are taken. Tens of thousands of people, many of Indian and Asian origin who have worked in Heathrow-linked roles directly or indirectly for at least three generations, have lost jobs”.“This is not scare-mongering. This government does not have a seriously thought-out plan to deal with the crisis not only in Heathrow but also other airports such as Gatwick. I and over 25 MPs wrote to chancellor Rishi Sunak about this in July,” he added.Sharma said he was already seeing the impact of Heathrow-linked job losses in his constituency. In Hounslow alone, the council estimates that at least 11,000 residents are employed at Heathrow, while up to 27,000 jobs in the borough are said to be linked to the airport.According to Holland-Kaye, the collapse of air traffic has put at risk tens of thousands of jobs. He wants the Boris Johnson government to allow testing at airports so that traffic could begin to return to 2019 levels and enable the crippled aviation industry to slowly recover.Heathrow estimates that it has suffered a loss of £1.1 billion in the first half of 2020 due to the pandemic.The Hounslow council said: “Independent research carried out by Oxford Economics forecasts the borough will be the second hardest hit in London, with a possible 40 per cent decline in output and thousands of jobs likely to be lost”.“A major factor is its proximity to Heathrow Airport and strong links to the aviation industry”, it added.Tens of thousands of people living in neighbouring boroughs are employed in four types of economic activity supported by Heathrow Direct on-airport: Located at Heathrow and includes roles such as management of airport, pilots, air traffic control, retail, catering, cleaning, securityDirect off-airport: Located mainly in close proximity to Heathrow, these jobs are reliant on the airport and include hotels, distribution and logistics activitiesIndirect and induced: Activity generated through supply chain spending and consumer spending.Catalytic: Companies are located in Heathrow because of the presence of the airport, typically to access international markets that the hub airport services.Economic forecasting and analysis organisation Oxford Economics said in a recent report titled ‘The economic impact of reduced activity at Heathrow’ that the airport is a key source of employment for people in neighbouring boroughs.It said: “The airport supports employment through four main channels of activity. However, the dramatic fall in passenger numbers and cargo at the airport threatens the security of many of the direct jobs located at Heathrow and surrounding it, as well as those in supply chains and subsequently those supported through the spending of wages”.“It could also impact on businesses that have located around the airport because of the international destinations it serves”.
There’s a chance water levels in the two largest man-made reservoirs in the United States could dip to critically low levels by 2025, jeopardizing the steady flow of Colorado River water that more than 40 million people rely on in the American West.After a relatively dry summer, the US Bureau of Reclamation released models on Tuesday suggesting looming shortages in Lake Powell and Lake Mead — the reservoirs where Colorado River water is stored — are more likely than previously projected.Compared with an average year, only 55 per cent of Colorado River water is flowing from the Rocky Mountains down to Lake Powell on the Utah-Arizona line. Due to the below-average runoff, government scientists say the reservoirs are 12 per cent more likely to fall to critically low levels by 2025 than they projected in the spring.“This is a pretty significant increase over what was projected in April due to the declining runoff this year,” hydrologist Carly Jerla said.The forecast could complicate already-fraught negotiations between Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, Wyoming and Mexico over future shares of the river that supplies their cities and farms. Those talks will draw up new agreements by 2026 over use of the river that’s under siege from climate change and prolonged drought.Some of urban and agricultural water users have been forced to conserve water to secure the river long term, but it remains overtapped. And as cities like Phoenix and Las Vegas keep growing, the region is only getting thirstier.“We know that warmer temperatures have contributed to the drought of the last 21 years, and we know that they have exacerbated it,” Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner Brenda Burman said.Unlike the 24-month projections that the agency uses to allocate water to the seven states and Mexico, the models released Tuesday simulate various weather and usage patterns to help water users prepare for different scenarios.Scientists use what’s called the Colorado River Simulation System to project future levels of the two reservoirs. They employed “stress testing” techniques based on river flows since 1988 to determine potential shortages if drought conditions persist.
The Supreme Court Thursday said it would pronounce its order on September 21 on a petition which has challenged the decision of National Law School of India University (NLSIU), Bengaluru, to conduct its separate entrance examination NLAT-2020. A bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan reserved its order on the plea filed by former NLSIU vice chancellor Professor R Venkata Rao and a parent of the aspirant.The apex court had on September 11 given its go ahead to NLSIU, Bengaluru to hold its separate exam, which was to be held on September 12, but restrained it from announcing the results and admitting any student till the pendency of the plea. The bench had said that it is an important matter which needs to be decided. It had issued notice to the university and its vice chancellor Professor Sudhir Krishnaswamy and sought their response on the plea. The plea has termed holding of separate examination as “manifestly arbitrary and illegal decision”.The NLSIU action has created an unprecedented uncertainty and has imposed an onerous burden and obligations upon thousands of aspirants, who are now uncertain about the future course of action, the plea has claimed. It has said such a unilateral decision to hold National Law Aptitude Test (NLAT) as entrance exam to the university was taken without any application of mind, “thereby completely prejudicing the students at the final hour and has put their career at jeopardy for purely whimsical reasons”.The plea has claimed it is apparent that the decision is solely directed at creating an “elitist institution” which caters to those who are able to afford to take the test, while “completely ignoring the aspirations of poor, marginalized, and less privileged candidates”.It has sought quashing of notification for admission to the five-year integrated BA, LLB (Hons.) programme, 2020-21 read with the press release on NLSIU Admissions 2020-21 dated September 4, 2020. “Through the impugned notification, the Respondent No. 1 University is in direct violation of the fundamental rights of the students who are desirous of gaining admission into the Respondent University, especially during the current and ongoing Covid-19 Pandemic,” it said. It further said that an executive council of NLSIU at its 91st meeting unanimously authorized the university to develop an alternative admissions process in the event that CLAT 2020 was further postponed due to the pandemic.“However, it is respectfully submitted that the Executive Council of the Respondent No. 1 University did not have any such powers vested in it and therefore meeting of the Executive Council for this very purpose was illegal and without any basis under its own bylaws,” the plea has said. The impugned notification provides that the NLSIU shall not accept the scores of CLAT 2020 for admission to academic year 2020-21 and an examination called NLAT be conducted online.“The sudden and capricious decision of the NLSIU has not only thrown the aspirants of CLAT 2020 into frenzy and in a state of fear and confusion, it has also severely jeopardized the position of the university in the Consortium. Due to the whimsical conduct of the University, the children are put to extreme pressure and mental stress,” the plea has said.
Facebook has been in the news in India for all the wrong reasons recently. A criminal case has been registered in Raipur against a top Facebook executive, Ankhi Das, for overlooking inflammatory posts by a politician, allegedly because removing it would anger the ruling dispensation. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress have been engaged in a war of words on this issue and it is likely to spill over into the next session of Parliament. There have also been allegations about the Arogya Setu app not being fully secure, but information technology minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has assured people that it is safe.Let us recall what happened with Cambridge Analytica. The company was alleged to have systematically influenced the 2016 United States (US) presidential election. There were claims that the company illegally monitored the accounts of around 85 million Facebook users.By doing this, it was able to discern what many Americans were thinking, what kind of leadership they were seeking and what policies appealed to them. These allegations were not fully substantiated, but it affected the company adversely. Facebook also had to pay a huge price for its actions, its shares nosedived by $119 billion in just one day.Private information barriers being breached is becoming a real danger. Due to the spread of Covid-19, different smartphone apps have become almost mandatory in almost every country. The data collected through these apps, if used for anything other than medical and scientific purposes, could seriously compromise the privacy of the individual.Until now, people were monitored through their physical movements and views expressed on social media. Now, for the first time, it would seem that your medical parameters could reach unknown corporates. They could ascertain who is a diabetic, hypertensive or what allergies a person could have. This can be abused, especially in places with a weak democracy or one without a robust and independent judiciary.This debate actually began in the mid-1990s and was initiated by Gabriel Baiman, a researcher at the University of Haifa, Israel. After extensive research, he found that 90% of the recruitment to terrorist organisations was done through social platforms.After a thorough reading of what topics people read, which videos they had seen, how they expressed their thoughts, what sort of messages they exchanged with loved ones and others, researchers were able to get an accurate picture of what was going on in the minds of young people.This information made it easier to influence them. It is easier to sow the seeds of hate. Jihadi John, an ISIS member from Britain, who became notorious for his beheading videos, was recruited through social media. A number of young Indians were also misled by propaganda on social media platforms.There was once a time when social media was the only window into people’s thoughts. This has changed over time. Various new avenues are available for people to pry into our personal space.This moves one step ahead when one uses these platforms to even acquire information about our whereabouts. Everything and everyone is online. There is no guarantee that this data will not reach a terrorist organisation, an anarchist group, a foreign government, rogue government officials or predatory drug companies.The Russian writer, philosopher and political prisoner, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, narrated a surreal story about the Soviet Union in his book The Gulag Archipelago. Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin was delivering a speech at a conference after which the audience broke into applause. Every person in the room began clapping wildly, with each person waiting for someone else to take the initiative to stop.At last, the director of a paper factory decided enough was enough. He stopped clapping and sat down, and right after that everyone else followed suit. The same night, he was arrested and sent to Siberia for the rest of his life. Now imagine this scenario. If Stalin had the means to ascertain how many people listening to him were truly interested in what he had to say, many more may have been exiled to Siberia.If North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un, could determine how many people in his council of ministers agreed with his policies, there is no telling what would happen to them. If physical indicators such as blood pressure could be monitored to gauge reactions to changes in government policy, people could be controlled more closely by the government.Confidential information falling into the wrong hands, or unknown hands, is a huge danger to all citizens of democratic countries.In his seminal novel, 1984, George Orwell wrote of “Big Brother” who was watching everyone. Today, Big Brother has acquired much more power and can look right into your body and record your vital functions.

Jofra Archer has responded to Michael Holding’s comments about England and Australia players not taking a knee in support of the BLM (Black Lives Matter) movement, saying it was harsh on the former West Indies quick’s part. Holding, who has been a vocal supported of the BLM movement had found it ‘lame’ that England, Pakistan and Australia failed to continue the practice of taking a knee which began when the English summer began in August.Archer, in his response, said that Holding may not be aware of it but the England cricket team is actively supporting the movement ‘in the background’ and that the former Windies quick should have not said what he did without doing proper research.“I’m pretty sure Michael Holding doesn’t know anything that is going on behind the scenes. I don’t think he has spoken to [ECB chief executive] Tom Harrison,” Archer said.“I’ve spoken to Tom and we have stuff running in the background. We’ve not forgotten. No-one here has forgotten about Black Lives Matter. I think that is a bit harsh for him to say that. I think it is a bit harsh for Mikey to not do some research before criticising.”Holding, however, did not hold back on his response to Archer, saying irrespective of whatever is being done to support BLM by the ECB, there is no connection between that and the gesture that is taking a knee. “Taking a knee does not prevent other action from taking place,” Holding told ESPNCricinfo.“Those who take a knee are not substituting the gesture for other positive action. Nobody should have a problem with it. It is a worldwide recognition of calling attention to racial prejudice and injustice.”
Covid-19, which has killed at least 200,000 Americans, may still claim the presidency of Donald Trump. A new book by journalist Bob Woodward, Rage, on the Trump administration quotes the president admitting that he deliberately played down the pandemic and that he knew it was much more lethal than seasonal influenza. The book adds to other unflattering revelations about Mr Trump’s disdain for men in uniform, his belief in dictatorship and the dysfunctionality of his family in articles, interviews and books written by his former lawyer, his niece and others who have worked with him. The question is whether any of this will make a difference to his re-election campaign.Mr Trump commands the blind loyalty of about 40% of the electorate. They believe he has been good for their livelihoods. They believe he has taken on the Washington “establishment”. They also believe in his not-so-discreet White supremacist politics. But this is not enough for him to win the elections. There is a broad consensus that a middle bloc of suburban women, Hispanics and educated conservative White men — many of whom support Mr Trump on policies but dislike his personality — will determine the final result. Mr Trump’s blatant attempts to play on racial and class fears aim to bring this group back into his fold. But many, especially women, are more concerned about the pandemic. These women voted for Barack Obama, turned against Hillary Clinton, and are now leaning towards Democratic candidate Joe Biden. Mr Woodward’s revelations and the growing number of Covid-19 cases in heartland America could just tip an election that is on a knife’s edge — or the point of a hypodermic syringe.
Over 500 intensive care unit (ICU) beds have been added in private sector hospitals for the treatment of Covid-19 patients in a week, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said on Saturday during an interaction with the press.“In the next two or three days, the numbers will go up further. ICU beds are being increased in the government hospitals as well. We are watching the capacity of all the hospitals regularly. Over 8,000 beds earmarked for the treatment of Covid-19 patients are still vacant. If need be, we will increase it further,” said Jain.“Even on the beds with ventilators, not many need it. As the number of ICU beds will go up, the ventilator beds will slowly get free,” he said.At present, there are 15,323 beds earmarked for the treatment of Covid-19 patients across government and private hospitals in the national capital. Of these, 7,025 or 45.8 percent beds were occupied as on Saturday evening, according to data from the government’s Delhi Corona app. There are a total of 2,909 ICU beds earmarked for Covid-19 in the city, of which 66.6 percent are currently occupied, data shows.With the government scaling up testing for Covid-19, Delhi has been recording over 4,000 new cases of Covid-19 every day for nearly ten days now. However, the cumulative positivity rate – total number of positive cases among the total number of people tested in the city so far – dipped below 10 percent on Friday, the health minister added.“The cumulative positivity rate of the cases reported so far has came down below 10 percent for the first time yesterday. So far, the positivity rate is 9.83 percent, earlier this was between 11 and 12 percent. The case fatality ratio (fraction of people who die among those tested positive) stands at 0.69 percent in the last ten days, and 2.05 percent cumulative for all deaths so far,” Jain said.He also said that the proportion of RT-PCR looks skewed because Delhi government has scaled up testing. “Show me one case in Delhi where a person wanted to get tested but could not. Even if they want RT-PCR test they can get it. But for surveillance in people without symptoms, rapid antigen tests can be done in bulk. The testing guidelines have also been revised to remove the need for doctors’ prescriptions,” the minister said.“In the last 10 to 12 days, we increased the number of tests, and in the last two days we have seen a downward trend in the positivity rate. The impact will be visible in the coming week,” he added.When asked whether there was community transmission in Delhi, he said, “Community transmission is a technical term, but with so many cases being reported from Delhi and other parts of the country community transmission should have been accepted. But, it is only the Centre and scientists from ICMR who can say so, however the infection is spreading in the community.”
The Maharashtra cabinet on Wednesday gave its approval to fill up 12,528 posts of police constables in the state. The Chief Minister’ Office (CMO) said this in a statement. In view of the Supreme Court’s recent interim order staying implementation of 2018 law that granted reservation to the Maratha community in education and jobs, the state cabinet directed the home department to take steps regarding the recruitment process in consultation with the law and judiciary department, it said.In 2019, a total of 5,297 posts for police constable were created, while in 2020, 6726 posts were created.Similarly, for the newly-created Mira Bhayandar and Vasai- Virar police commissionerates, 505 of the 975 posts are to be filled in the first phase, the statement said.“All the 12,528 posts will be filled,” it said.The cabinet also gave its go-ahead to the extension of the Balasaheb Thackeray Road Accident Insurance Scheme in the state.For this, funds would be provided to the State Health Guarantee Society. Insurance companies will be selected through due procedure. Beneficiaries would be victims of road accidents irrespective of the region, the statement said.An accident victim will be provided medical aid and financial assistance during the ‘golden hour’.Golden hour refers to the first hour after a traumatic injury when emergency treatment is very crucial.On the state highways and rural areas, 13,000 people are killed every year in road accidents, while 40,000 people are injured, the statement said.“If these people got medical aid quickly, their lives could have been saved,” it added.Under this insurance scheme, the victim will be treated at a nearest hospital for the first 72 hours.Medical expenses of Rs 30,000 will be free of cost for 74 kinds of medical treatment.Accidents taking place in industrial units, day-to-day work or at residence are not liable for benefit under this scheme, the statement clarified.
On Monday night, India repelled — yet again — a possible attempt by China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to intrude into Indian territory across the Line of Actual Control (LAC). This comes a week after India successfully resisted such attempts, and held on to strategic positions on the southern banks of the Pangong Tso. The escalation in tensions in eastern Ladakh is not surprising. With both armies, mobilised in large numbers and staring at eachother in close proximity, it is but natural that skirmishes will happen — especially when one army, PLA, wants to change the facts on the ground and force India to accept a new reality. It is also natural because over the past fortnight, there has been a sharp uptick in rhetoric on both sides.All of this indicates that the India-China relationship has broken down at two levels. The first is with regard to the border management framework that has been in place for close to three decades. It is clear that China no longer sees the advantage of maintaining peace and tranquility on the border — and is keen to maintain this peace only on its terms, after wresting territory over which it has no legitimate claim. This is unacceptable to India, and rightly so. The second is with regard to the broader framework of the relationship. For years, India has convinced itself that the dynamic with China has both a cooperative and competitive element — and while this was true, it is also now clear that the competitive dynamic is on the ascendant, and is becoming sharply adversarial.With external affairs minister S Jaishankar scheduled to meet his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, in Moscow on Thursday, it is this breakdown that must be the focus of the discussion. Is it the case that China has decided that it is comfortable with a hot LAC, and an outright adversarial relationship with India? If that is so — and the conversation will give the Indian establishment a sense of Beijing’s mood — India has no choice but to prepare itself in the military, economic, diplomatic domains and respond accordingly. Or is it the case that China has read Indian motivations wrong, that apprehensions can be allayed, and Beijing can be persuaded to disengage and de-escalate? If that is so, it will help tackle the immediate crisis — even though the long- term orientation of the relationship will still be troubled.India must hope for accommodation, even as it prepares for confrontation.
The Covid-19 pandemic may have turned the world of several firms in the gig economy upside down, but it could not deter two graduates of business management in Odisha’s capital city of Bhubaneswar from starting their own food ordering platform amid an environment of overwhelming gloom.In August, 20-year-olds Suryanshu Panda and Epari Pritam, graduates from Bhubaneswar’s Xavier’s University of Business, started www.chefjunction.in, an online food ordering platform that fashions itself as the only platform that delivers food prepared at home.“Unlike Swiggy, Zomato or UberEats, our food ordering platform delivers food prepared by people at home. Due to the high amount of spices and poor quality of cooking oil used by restaurants, food quality in local restaurants have always been a matter of concern. During the pandemic, when immunity is the biggest issue, we realised a business opportunity exists as many people may not be ready to order such food from restaurants. After some brainstorming, we decided to start a food ordering platform that would connect customers to people cooking food in their homes,” said Panda, who did his Bachelors in business administration this year with specialisation in human resources.Panda’s batch mate Pritam, who did his BBA in marketing and shared his love for food, was too enthused to join. “Before the pandemic, both of us were planning to launch a start-up in advertising. But after some research, we realised that we may not get the clients we desired. As both of us were foodies and faced issues in getting quality food during college days, we agreed on a food start-up after 5 months of planning,” said Pritam, who hails from a businessman family.The two friends then pooled in Rs 1.5 lakh, rented an office space opposite a mall in the city and hired around half a dozen people. They then contacted several people in the city whose culinary skills were known in their small social circles and signed them up for the food platform.“Before we sign in a person for cooking food for our customers, the first thing we see is what kind of oils and spices they are using. If a home cook wants to join, they call us and we get to taste their food. If we like it we get them a licence under the food safety & standards authority of India (FSSAI) which is mandatory for any food business operator under the Foof Safety and Standards Act, 2006. The licence remains valid for 1 year,” said Panda. “For ensuring quality, we conduct surprise checks by ordering from the cooks without them recognising us.”Also Read: Odisha JEE 2020 Date: Exam to begin from October 12The start-up has so far signed in 30 home cooks across the city and has hired a dozen delivery boys who bike around the city wearing gloves and masks to deliver the food at doorsteps. Till September 6, the platform has delivered more than 1200 orders.“At a time when most of the business is not seeing much uptick, we are doing pretty decently. In the last one month, we have managed Rs 1.7 lakh turnover. We keep 15-20 per cent margins on the food and fix costs of each item so that they are affordable. As the food is being cooked by our chefs at their homes, the customer is relieved about the hygiene and taste. For many of our home cooks the platform has brought in extra income at a difficult time,” said Panda.Also Read: Death of two sloth bears in Odisha’s Nandankanan zoo spreads panicThe duo aims to expand their food business to Cuttack in the next 2 months and then take it to southern cities in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. They also want to make it available on a mobile app like Zomato and Swiggy soon.

A Bollywood actor late on Saturday accused filmmaker Anurag Kashyap of sexual assault. In an interview, she mentioned that the incident happened during the making of Bombay Velvet. Anurag later took to Twitter to deny all claims and called them baseless.Taking to Twitter, Anurag wrote in Hindi, “Kya baat hai, itna samay le liya mujhe chup karwane ki koshish mein. Chalo koi nahin. Mujhe chup karaate karaate itna jhoot bol gaye ki aurat hote hue doosri auraton ko bhi sang ghhaseet liya. Thodi toh maryada rakheye, madam.

He said he has received a number of phone calls, asking him not to respond.अभी तो बहुत आक्रमण होने वाले हैं। यह बस शुरुआत है । बहुत फ़ोन आ चुके हैं, कि नहीं मत बोल और चुप हो जा । यह भी पता है कि पता नहीं कहाँ कहाँ से तीर छोड़ें जाने वाले हैं । इंतेज़ार है । — Anurag Kashyap (@anuragkashyap72) September 19, 2020The actor in question had also tweeted about the incident. She also got a response from Rekha Sharma, chairperson, National Commission for Women, who asked her to send her a detailed complaint on the matter. The actor had later thanked Rekha for her response.

Smoke from California and Oregon wildfires has cloaked Canada’s third-largest city of Vancouver -- known for its majestic mountain views and fresh ocean breezes -- in the dirtiest air in the world this week.Days have been spent smarting under a thick haze that has irritated eyes and throats, and sent asthmatics gasping for breath. It has also complicated Covid-19 testing.On Friday, despite forecasted smoke-clearing rain storms, the city -- 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) north of the biggest California fires -- topped for the second time this week the World Air Quality Index for worst air, after briefly ceding first place to Portland in fire-stricken Oregon.“I’m out of breath all the time, my chest feels like it’s exploding, I feel like I’m going to suffocate,” Fatima Jaffer, a doctoral student at the University of British Columbia, told AFP.“I’m afraid of the long-term damage this smoke might do to my lungs and my asthma.”Authorities for the metropolitan region of 2.5 million residents issued daily air quality warnings since September 8, with things so bad that Vancouver opened five filtered “clean air shelters.”It’s equivalent to smoking eight cigarettes a day, researchers noted. Health officials urged all citizens to close windows and avoid strenuous exercise or outdoor activities -- especially those with respiratory illness.Jaffer, 58, said her worsening asthma added to a sense of panic and dread, as she had just recovered from Covid-19, which robbed her of her sense of smell. Now she worries the smog could increase her odds of reinfection or cause new health complications.“I’d just gotten to the place of getting over the fear of Covid-19 and felt like I could breathe again,” she said, “and now I literally can’t.”It’s been an “entire horrible week for air quality,” said Armel Castellan, a federal warning preparedness meteorologist. “The fine particulate has brought our Air Quality Health Index up off the charts.”“There’s no doubt this is very massive and very concerning,” he said.Covid-19 and wildfire smokeThe same people are at most risk of smoke inhalation and the coronavirus, according to provincial health officer Bonnie Henry. The past month has seen British Columbia’s active Covid-19 cases surge 130 percent, hitting highs more than double those at the pandemic’s April peak.“For many of us, there’s confusion about what symptoms are caused by smoky skies, and what symptoms are caused by Covid-19,” Henry told a news conference, “particularly for people who have underlying lung disease, asthma, heart disease and diabetes.”Another vulnerable group are Vancouver’s more than 2,000 homeless residents, many of whom have chronic illness, a recent survey found.“If you’re outside and homeless, and surrounded by this smoke and the pandemic, you can’t get away from any of these things,” said Jeremy Hunka, with Union Gospel Mission. “It’s hitting a group of people that generally have been just left far more vulnerable.”For North Vancouver professional dog-walker Barry Appal, 64, he and his wife ten years his senior have had to wear masks outdoors and avoid usual strenuous trails.“After a half-hour you could feel it in your lungs and get a headache,” he said. “We’re active and healthy, but with Covid-19 around, picking up any respiratory thing could become a bigger problem than normal.”He’s most worried for his 30-something nephew with cystic fibrosis.“He’s very susceptible to anything to do with his lungs,” Appal said. “He’s already freaked out about Covid -- that could wipe him right out at the drop of a hat.”Meteorologist Castellan said conditions should improve next week thanks to brewing Pacific storms clearing the air.But with the “fingerprints of climate change” clearly visible in the year-after-year worsening wildfire seasons, “We’re not done with this yet,” he warned.
The British described India as an ocean of trees. This tree cover was nurtured by village and tribal communities. To organise the drain of India, as Dadabhai Naoroji put it, the British destroyed these community organisations and took over forest land as State property. Only Goa was spared. Initially, the Portuguese attempted to break down village communities, but stopped when faced with substantial losses in land revenue. Goa, therefore, remained an ocean of trees till 1961, attracting hordes of tourists. To this day, the gavkari, or “communidad” organisation continues to bravely hold on to Goa’s natural heritage.Gadchiroli, Maharashtra’s easternmost district, has the highest level of tree cover in the state at over 70%, safeguarded by its predominantly tribal population. It is the one district where the Community Forest Resource (CFR) rights and provision of FRA have been implemented properly, with thousands of villages being assigned lakhs of hectares to manage minor forest produce sustainably.This was the result of a combination of capable tribal leadership and competent and honest officials. CFRs have been granted from 2009 and have led to skill development and community-based employment. Before the Act was in place, young women in Gadchiroli had a taste of the government’s ill-conceived skill development plan when they were trained to become air hostesses. On completing the course, no airline was willing to employ the women.Pachgaon, a village in neighbouring Chandrapur district, has been assigned CFR rights over 1,000 hectares. The gram sabha asked each family to submit five rules regarding management of forest resources and other civic affairs.These were then discussed in a meeting over two days and 115 rules were unanimously accepted. The entire community now abides by these 115 rules. These include regimes regarding the harvest of bamboo and other minor forest produce, regular patrolling of CFR areas and sharing of responsibility in sorting and auctioning bamboo. The villagers used to earn to a fair income plucking tendu leaves for contractors earlier. But this involved setting fire to parts of the forest, which the people deemed undesirable. The tendu trees are now producing an abundance of fruit. This fruit is in high demand and, in the long-run, the village may become economically better-off selling the fruit rather than plucking the leaves. The wages for bamboo harvest were three times what contractors paid.Nevertheless, they managed to make a net profit of Rs 35 lakh from the sale of bamboo in 2015. This has been invested in organising forest and village development works which provide year-round employment. Prior to being empowered by the CFR rights, many villagers used to migrate all the way to Gujarat to earn a living. Now, no one leaves the village.The lessons from villages such as Pachgaon must reach all other CFR-holding villages. To kick off such a process, Maharashtra’s tribal development department sponsored a special five-month training programme in the field at Mendha-Lekha, the first village to win CFR rights in 2009. I was associated with this programme in which 24 young men and three women were trained. Following the training, they have formed groups of villages, processing and marketing minor forest produce, while diligently maintaining accounts and paying taxes.Or take Kudumbasree, a network of community-based women’s self-help groups from Kerala, which provides a different kind of experience in strengthening community organisation. This network is engaged primarily in activities related to food production, processing and restaurants. Large tracts of farmland are fallow in Kerala because the owners find the costs of chemical inputs and labour prohibitive. Kudumbasree groups take such lands on lease and make them productive. They can afford to do so because, without alternative employment, their members accept lower wages. They don’t use chemical inputs, thereby reducing the cost of cultivation and taking pesticides out of the ecosystem. As a result, they are successfully in practising organic cultivation.Empowering communities through organisation and resource rights is a very effective and desirable route to both employment generation and skill development. India needs to think of an alternative economic paradigm to prevent the distress we have seen this year.Madhav Gadgil is former professor, Indian Institute of Science where he founded the Centrefor Ecological SciencesThe views expressed are personal
China on Saturday launched a mechanism that would allow it to sanction foreign companies, upping the ante in a tech war with the United States a day after Washington moved to curb popular Chinese apps TikTok and WeChat.China’s long-expected “unreliable entities list” is seen as a weapon for Beijing to retaliate against the United States, which has used its own “entity list” to shut Chinese telecom giant Huawei out of the US market, while also moving against TikTok and WeChat.Its implementation comes just a day after the US Commerce Department stepped up the pressure by ordering a ban on downloads of video app TikTok and effectively blocking use of WeChat, the Chinese super-app.An announcement by China’s Ministry of Commerce did not mention any specific foreign entities that could be targeted.But it said the new system would consider sanctions on entities whose activities “harm China’s national sovereignty, security, and development interests” or violate “internationally accepted economic and trade rules”.That language closely tracks wording that Beijing has used to repeatedly denounce US actions against Chinese companies.Punitive measures may include fines against the foreign entity, banning it from conducting trade and investment in China, and restrictions on the entry of personnel or equipment into the country.It covers “foreign enterprises, other organisations and individuals”, the ministry said.‘Unreliable’Under Friday’s US order against the Chinese apps, Tencent-owned WeChat would lose functionality in the United States from Sunday. TikTok users will be banned from installing updates but could keep accessing the service through November 12.That timeframe potentially allows for a tie-up between TikTok, owned by China’s ByteDance, and a US company to safeguard data for the wildly popular app to allay Washington’s security concerns.With President Donald Trump facing a tough re-election campaign, US officials have described the measures as essential to safeguard national security from potential Chinese espionage through the platforms.But in a response to the US steps, China’s Commerce Ministry on Saturday condemned what it called US “bullying”, saying it violated international trade norms and that there was no evidence of any security threat, shortly before announcing the new sanctions regime.Bytedance late Friday asked a US court to block the ban on downloading the TikTok app, asserting that it would respect the security and privacy of American users.The administration’s decision was made “for political reasons rather than because of any ‘unusual and extraordinary threat’ to the United States,” the parent company said in the court filing.It also maintained that the ban violates the right to free speech as well as due process, both enshrined in the US Constitution.Critics added that while the security risks were unclear, the sweeping ban raises concerns about the US government’s ability to regulate free expression.“It’s a mistake to think of this as (only) a sanction on TikTok and WeChat. It’s a serious restriction on the First Amendment rights of US citizens and residents,” said Jameel Jaffer, director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University.Some analysts say Trump’s moves are motivated more by business competition than security concerns.The moves would effectively disable US use of WeChat -- a so-called super-app used for messaging, shopping, payments and other services -- and TikTok from the online marketplaces operated by Apple and Google.After Sunday, services on WeChat will be “degraded”, said a senior US Commerce Department official, who added that existing users may retain some capability.WeChat is widely used among Chinese expats to keep in touch with people back home. A court challenge to the ban by US-based WeChat users is pending.Pressure grows for a dealExisting TikTok users will be able to continue using the app until November 12 -- when it would also face a full ban on its US operations if no deal is reached, according to officials.TikTok’s brand of brief, quirky phone videos has become hugely popular, especially among young people, with 100 million users in the US alone.One potential deal would allow Silicon Valley giant Oracle to become the tech partner for TikTok, but some US lawmakers have objected to allowing ByteDance to keep a stake.Trump said Friday a deal could happen quickly.“For ByteDance, their back is against the wall to accept the terms of the deals outlined over the past few days,” Daniel Ives at Wedbush Securities said in a research note.“We still believe a deal can be reached and this shutdown averted although it’s a critical 48 hours ahead for deal negotiations between all parties involved.”

Universal and round-the-clock access to affordable electricity is a prerequisite for India’s sustained economic growth. India is currently the world’s third-largest producer of electricity with an installed capacity of 371 GW. Going ahead, rapid growth and urbanisation will drive up the demand for electricity manifold, necessitating a healthy, efficient and consumer-centric power sector. It is in this light that an overhaul of The Electricity Act 2003 has been proposed. Many provisions of the 2003 Act are now archaic, given the sector’s rapid evolution, and this has resulted in several inefficiencies and challenges creeping in, hampering further growth.Foremost among these is a cash-strapped distribution sector, the weakest link in the value chain. Most distribution companies (discoms) today are beset with operational inefficiencies and acute financial crunch, with high Aggregate Technical and Commercial (AT&C) losses (averaging around 22%). Unsustainably designed tariff structures coupled with collection inefficiencies have played havoc with discoms’ cash flows, leading to their delaying payments to generators and also curtailing power purchase, both dampening investments in the sector.Over the last few years, we have been seeing a transition from fossil fuels to cleaner sources such as renewables, and the power sector must be future-ready to handle the interplay of distributed energy resources, storage, electric vehicle (EV) charging requirements and other emerging technologies. While these technologies have set the stage for next-generation technology reforms, legislative reforms are required to boost the sector’s viability while promoting transparency and accountability.Recognising this, even amid Covid-19, the government refocused its attention on power sector reforms, with landmark measures including a Rs 90,000 crore liquidity infusion to help discoms service overdue payments. However, it is the government’s draft Electricity Amendment Bill (2020) that has generated maximum interest, as it promises sweeping structural reforms to fix the health of distribution companies, boost investor sentiments and ensure the long-term sustainability of the power sector. The amendments proposed are forward-looking and impactful, which should pave the way for a thriving power sector.Some of the key positive tenets of the Bill include the following:One, it aims to help liquidity-starved discoms by mandating determination of tariffs purely on costs basis, without taking into account subsidies, which would be directly paid to consumers. This could solve discoms’ chronic cash-flow woes, enabling them to invest in improving infrastructure and clear outstanding dues. This will also boost transparency, as discoms will no longer be able to mask their inefficiencies. In parallel, rationalisation of tariff will ease the burden on industries making them competitive and support the atma nirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India) initiative. This should also ensure financial discipline across the value chain of the power sector.Two, the strengthening of the regulatory ecosystem for dispute resolution is also a welcome step. The proposal to bolster the strength of the appellate tribunal will help in speedy resolution of cases. A 60-day window for adopting tariffs post bidding is also a positive step to check unnecessary delays that bother investors. The Electricity Contract Enforcement Authority (ECEA) with civil court powers will help uphold contract sanctity, and should inspire confidence among private investors hamstrung by delayed payments, unilateral tariff and renegotiations on power purchase agreements, and random curtailments in offtake. However, to avoid complexities, the jurisdictional boundaries of Electricity Regulatory Commission and the proposed Electricity Contract Enforcement Authority need to be clearly defined.Three, enhancing private sector participation in the distribution sector by allowing sub-licensees will help attract capital, boost efficiency and improve service delivery. We have already seen public-private partnership models running successfully in Delhi and Mumbai. However, further clarity is required on structure, responsibilities and compensation mechanisms, and there must be adequate grievance redressal avenues to handle friction arising from possible rent-seeking behaviour.Four, the National Renewable Energy Policy will provide impetus to clean energy transition by creating a conducive investment climate and enabling market mechanisms. This will usher in a uniform, unambiguous regulatory ecosystem across the nation for promoting renewables at the state-level that is fully aligned to the Centre’s vision. High penalties for dishonouring Renewable Purchase Obligations should improve compliance and accelerate renewables’ adoption. As a next step, the government should consider an integrated National Clean Energy Policy focusing on resources and technologies including storage, energy efficiency, EVs and grid integration.The proposed reforms reflect the Centre’s intent to create a robust power sector for fuelling post-pandemic economic recovery. It is critical that these amendments see the light of day. Not surprisingly, it has met with resistance from some states, expressing concerns about the centralisation of powers, increasing privatisation and questioning the efficacy of the direct benefit transfer model for subsidising consumers. At the same time, there are states that have already started to move in the right direction, even in absence of the amendments.The proposed reforms can infuse much-needed momentum into the power sector if properly implemented and this needs the Centre and states to work in unison. This is an opportunity for the central and state governments to bury political motives and cooperate in the larger national interest for a vibrant power sector.Sumant Sinha is chairman and managing director of ReNew PowerThe views expressed are personal
While a lot has been written about the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 from the academic, political, and ideological lens, the perspective of students has been missing. This is in keeping with the discourse on education, which marginalises the most important stakeholder. NEP itself neglects the concerns and aspirations of the young, especially first-generation learners.One, the question of access. Young people from poor and marginalised backgrounds who want to study in colleges are completely dependent on external financial support. It is thus surprising that when the policy identifies the “major problems faced by the higher education system in India” (Section 9.2), it makes no mention of the crippling lack of funds for the higher education sector.It is this lack of public investment which explains why almost 80% of colleges are private, and why even public universities are being privatised by transitioning to “self-financing” courses. It is because of lack of public investment that many public universities shockingly don’t hold classes as there aren’t enough teachers for all the enrolled students. And it is lack of public investment that denies six out of seven students enrolled in central universities affordable accommodation. The policy barely mentions hostels, but for large numbers of first-generation learners who secure admission in state and central universities away from home, the lack of affordable accommodation is a significant barrier to completing education. For instance, average tuition fees in Allahabad University is about ~1,000 annually, but room and board costs of ~45,000 to ~ one lakh annually are prohibitive for most poor students.If education has to provide a pathway for socio-economic mobility for our aspirational young, it can only be through publicly -funded education. Yet, when the policy talks of improving access to education, it says only that “there shall, by 2030, be at least one large multidisciplinary HEI (higher educational institution) in or near every district”, without mandating that this HEI be publicly-funded. The failure to highlight the lack of funding as a central problem with the education system and the absence of any timebound redress, especially in the face of declining expenditure (from 4.14% in the 2014 Budget to 3.3% in 2020) is a capitulation. A statement of intent to enhance funding isn’t enough.Two, NEP’s disregard of students and their perspective is also evident when it talks of governance of HEIs (Section 19). The policy says that over the next 15 years, all HEIs will become “self-governing” through the institution of a “Board of Governors (BoG)...consisting of a group of highly qualified, competent, and dedicated individuals having proven capabilities and a strong sense of commitment to the institution”. At no point in this section, or throughout the policy, is there any mention of democratic student representation in academic and administrative decision-making. NEP wants to promote critical thinking in the students, but fails to acknowledge that the first pre-requisite of critical thinking is a democratic atmosphere where students are encouraged to participate in decision-making. This is all the more important because in universities across the country, the administration is cracking down on free speech and deploying disproportionately punitive measures to keep dissenting students in check. A policy empathetic to students would have also acknowledged the skewed balance of power between the students and the administration and faculty in most HEIs, and underscored the need for transparency (beyond financial disclosures) and grievance redress measures. In this context, the National Students Union of India (NSUI) has drafted students’ rights act, which codifies the minimum non-negotiable rights of a student in any college or university and series of escalating institutional measures to help enforce these rights.Three, a policy sensitive to the needs and interests of our young people would put online education in its place as a tool to supplement or enhance the university experience, and not supplant it altogether. The university is a place for learning more than information; it is the place where most young people get their first taste of independence, develop a sense of self and build networks. These are often a bigger determinant of a student’s future trajectory, and it would be unfair to equate the university experience with the singular pursuit of education online.And four, a sensitive policy would acknowledge that for many young people, the raison d’être for higher education is better employment opportunities. This leads to two imperatives. First, to eliminate the political-commercial nexus at the heart of our education system and rationalise the supply of third-rate colleges in fields such as engineering and business administration; and second, proactively using academia to structure and formalise emerging professions and employment instead of merely letting young people become fodder for the informal gig economy. Yet the policy is silent on both these issues.For too long, the education system has talked down to young people, treating them as passive recipients of top-down wisdom. This is one of the main reasons for the poor quality of education in our country. A policy which aims to reform our education sector to produce “engaged, productive, and contributing citizens for building an equitable, inclusive, and plural society” does a great disservice to its own stated intent by bypassing students entirely.Ruchi Gupta is All India Congress joint secretary in charge of its student wing.The views expressed are personal.
The Union environment ministry on Saturday told Parliament that the Char Dham road project to connect four Hindu pilgrimage sites in Uttarakhand has not been referred to it for appraisal as it did not need to be appraised even as it has involved the loss of trees and ecological damage to the fragile Himalayas.It cited an August 2013 notification exempting all projects related to the expansion of national highways up to 100 km from the preview of the Environmental Impact Assessment Notification, 2006. The exemption was granted on the recommendation of a high-level committee constituted to review the provisions in the notification related to environmental clearance for roads, buildings, and special economic zone projects.“In view of the... thresholds applicable to roads in Char Dham projects, no project has been referred to the MoEFCC [Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change] for appraisal,” the ministry told Rajya Sabha.The ministry was responding to a question on whether mandatory Environment Impact Assessment was avoided to fast-track the project and the reason for fast-tracking it in hilly and mountainous terrain.The 900-km Char Dham project will connect pilgrimage sites in Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri, and Yamunotri.A Supreme Court-appointed high-powered committee has flagged environmental violations in the execution of the project, including felling of thousands of trees without approval and unsafe construction practices. The violations may have activated landslides in certain areas, it said.The Supreme Court on September 9 ruled the width of the Char Dham highway shall not exceed the 5.5 metres the Union road transport ministry has specified in 2018 for the construction of roads in the mountainous terrain.The ministry separately told Rajya Sabha that forest land larger than Delhi and slightly smaller than Goa has been approved for non-forestry purposes like mining, irrigation, and hydropower from 2008 and 2020.It said 247843.49 ha of forest land has been approved for diversion under the Forest Conservation Act. The ministry added certificates of compliance with the Act for diversion of forest land are obtained from district collectors. It added the proposals for such diversions have been placed before concerned village councils and forest-dwellers. The ministry said they have certified all processes under the Act and given their consent for the diversion and compensation, etc.“We have to start moving away from hyper-legal and technocratic approach to protecting the environment. Environment regulation requires a much more reflexive approach and defensive one. The approval of the Char Dham project is yet another case in point when poorly thought out and hasty decisions have resulted in severe and irreversible damage. Acknowledging it will not just help taking project specific remedial action, but also allow us to bring back progressive legal measures that may have been undone through numerous exemptions introduced by successive governments,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher at Centre for Policy Research.
Last week, I received news from two of my former BBC colleagues about the death of Charles Allen, the historian who had striven to present a balanced view of modern Indian history, and in particular, but not exclusively, of the role of the British in that history. In his obituary in Outlook, Zareer Masani, a historian himself and BBC radio producer as well as presenter, said Allen’s death “deprived modern Indian history of one of its best informed, most balanced, and yet most modest voices”. In his obituary published in The Guardian, David Loyn, my successor as BBC Delhi Correspondent said, “Charles never hid the dark side of Empire but wanted it fairly represented.”In his prodigious output of 25 books, Charles wrote about many disputed issues in Indian history some of which have political implications today; so, I thought I would be justified in devoting a column to him.He was a member of the sixth generation of his family to be born in India. His father was a political officer in the hills of the Northeast but he was educated in England. Extraordinarily for someone who achieved such distinction as a historian, he did not go on from school to university and he had no formal academic education. Allen first came to the public’s notice with his BBC radio series called Plain Tales from the Raj, programmes based on fascinating interviews with Britons who had served in many different occupations in pre-Independence India. The interviews were conducted between 1972 and 1974.His books on the British Orientalists, late 18th century scholars such as William Jones — who founded the Asiatic Society in Calcutta to promote Oriental studies and suggested links between European languages and Sanskrit — argued that they had rediscovered India’s past achievements. This inevitably involved him in controversy with Edward Said’s famous scathing dismissal of Orientalism. Allen argued, “What Professor Said and his many supporters have consistently failed to ask is where would we be without the Orientalists? They initiated the discovery of South Asia’s past.” The past the Orientalists revealed is grist to the mill of political theories based on the concept of “India’s glorious past”.Although Allen was no imperialist and was particularly critical of British racism inevitably, his view of the work of the Orientalists also challenged the schools of history, including Hindutva, which see no good in the British record. But the most prominent denigrator of the Raj is the Congress politician Shashi Tharoor. When speaking in public, Allen would point out that it was a British official, Sir John Munro, who persuaded the rulers of the two Kerala princely states, Travancore and Cochin, to moderate the oppressive behaviour of their Namboodari and Nair castes. This opened the way to the progress in their states that Tharoor is justifiably proud of.The last time I heard from Allen, he said he was working on a book and hoped to finish it before cancer ended his life. Fortunately, he succeeded by working right up to the end. The book, Aryans, The Search for a People a Place and a Myth, will certainly ruffle feathers among politicians, especially in the Sangh parivar, when it is published next year. According to Masani, it is based on genetic data collected and analysed by Harvard University that confirms the DNA of upper castes in Northern India was Indo-European. This, of course, supports the theory of Aryan migration and challenges the Hindutva view.The arguments about Aryan migration will go back and forth but there is no doubt that Charles Allen, like the Orientalists he admired, has deeply enriched the study of Indian history.The views expressed are personal

Aameen,” a third wrote.Mahira is a single parent. She divorced Azlan’s father, Ali Askari, in 2015. In an earlier interview with The Quint, she said that she was an ‘anomaly’ in Pakistan, being a single mother. She also said that her son came first for her. “My first priority is my child. It’s a lot of hard work, but it can be done. It’s all about choices. Many times, I have to let go of good work. Fortunately, the work I’ve done has worked for me.”In 2017, Mahira made her Bollywood debut with Rahul Dholakia’s Raees, opposite Shah Rukh Khan. She was unable to come to India to promote her film due to strained bilateral ties after the Uri attack of 2016. However, she joined one of the press meets through video conferencing and said that she was grateful for the response her character had received.
It’s tough to be a budding cricketer in Afghanistan and it was even tougher when Rashid Khan was growing up. Young Afghan boys now have Rashid, Mohammad Nabi, Asghar Afghan and a host of other stars to look up to but it was different when these cricketers were growing up.Also Read | Maxwell, Carey star with centuries as Australia win thriller to capture seriesWith there being no role models in the country, Rashid had to look elsewhere to draw inspiration for cricket, and it came from two neighbouring countries India and Pakistan. Rashid said he learnt a lot by watching former India captain and coach Anil Kumble and ex-Pakistan all-rounder Shahid Afridi while growing up.Also Read | Back to Sharjah, home of rivalries and controversy“It was tough for me because we didn’t have any role models in cricket because we didn’t have a team that was playing international cricket. Since childhood, I was a big fan of Shahid Afridi and Anil Kumble. I loved watching their bowling. I learnt a lot by watching them.” Rashid told Ravichandran Ashwin in his YouTube show DRS with Ash.The Afghanistan leg-spinner, one of the biggest cricketing stars of the country, said Kumble and Afridi’s bowling motivated him and gave him the energy to represent his own country someday.“It motivated me and gave me the energy that one day I will represent my country,” Rashid, who will play for Sunrisers Hyderabad in IPL 2020 said.Rashid believes Afghanistan have the talent and skills to win ICC tournaments and only needs regular cricket against top nations to get there.“I think the biggest achievement (for Afghanistan) should be, right now, what the team is looking for, what the country is expecting is, to win the T20 World Cup,” he said.“We have all the skills, talent, and we just need to have that belief in ourselves that we can do it. Talent-wise we are so good, we have the spinners, we have the fast bowlers, we have the batting skills as well. But what took us down in that Test (against India) was our experience against big teams, because we didn’t play enough cricket with them.”
On Tuesday, the Sushant Singh Rajput case took a new turn with the arrest of actor Rhea Chakraborty in a drug-related case. This newspaper has been critical of the electronic media’s coverage of Rajput’s suicide — and the nature of the sensationalist conspiracy theories that have come to dominate a case which should have triggered a discussion on mental health. But it is not just the media which is in the dock; the problem is with India’s law enforcement apparatus and police agencies.Irrespective of the merits of the investigation underway, what is increasingly apparent is that all central and state agencies appear to be operating under political directions, for this case is now clearly linked to politics. On one hand are those who believe that Ms Chakraborty is responsible for Rajput’s tragic death. This view seems to have the support, if not the concurrence, of leaders in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) — and the social media campaign against her has the sanction of supporters of the party. It is, therefore, not a coincidence that it is central agencies which are at the forefront of implicating Ms Chakraborty in a range of cases. On the other are those who believe that Rajput’s death is being used to target the Mumbai film industry and its leading figures, and there is an attempt to muddy a normal police investigation in the matter. It is not a coincidence that the Maharashtra state administration in general is applying the law against those who it sees as critics.The issue here is not who is right or wrong. The issue is the complete politicisation of India’s premier security agencies, which seem to act not on the basis of evidence but primarily on political directions. India’s governance structure, of course, has a framework where the state police in the case of states, and other investigative agencies in the case of the Centre, operate under executive control. Political oversight is important. At the same time, there is a desperate need for autonomy — for as repeated attempts at police reforms have shown, it is when investigative agencies are free of political pressure that they can work fairly. There cannot be any rule of law if those meant to protect and uphold the law cannot do their jobs independently. The Sushant case is yet again proof that India needs to find ways to insulate its legal machinery from political masters. Otherwise, driven by an irresponsible media and partisan political considerations, individual liberty will be at peril.
Filmmaker Luca Guadagnino says the decision to not include intimate same-sex scenes in his Oscar-winning romance drama Call Me By Your Name was a creative choice.In an interview with The Independent, the filmmaker finally addressed the criticism of veteran screenwriter James Ivory for the lack of male nudity in the movie. Defending his decision, Guadagnino said he has never shied away from presenting any kind of nudity in his films.“Nobody who knows my work can say to me with a straight face that I’m shy about male or female or other gendered nudity. So, the critique or note that James gave was, in a way, devoid of pragmatism or a relationship with the movie itself.“My question to him is does this movie need full frontal male nudity. I don’t think so. It doesn’t,” he said. The filmmaker also believes that Ivory was “tone deaf” to criticise the film.“Maybe the script which he wrote – which was a draft which then I reworked with my editor – was compelled to tell this story through the perspective of a very expositionary kind of nudity. “But that would have been his idea of the movie which, unfortunately, we haven’t seen… so I don’t know. I think James was a little tone deaf about the situation,” Guadagnino added.Ivory, who adapted the story from Andre Aciman’s novel of the same name and won an Oscar for Best Screenplay, had said avoiding nudity in films always seemed “phony” to him.Call Me By Your Name is a coming-of-age story about 17-year-old Elio who falls in love with Oliver, an older intern who’s come to spend the summer working with Elio’s father at the family’s Italian villa. The film made an overnight star out of lead actor Timothee Chalamet, who played Elio in the movie.During the interview, Guadagnino also talked about the criticism many directors have faced over casting straight actors for LGBTQ characters.“I honestly don’t believe I have the right to decide whether an actor is straight or not. Who am I to know what somebody is thinking of himself or herself within themselves. Yes, Armie is a straight man with a wife and children and the same can be said of Timothee. But do I ask them to swear on their sexuality, on their identities, on their desires, before I cast them? I don’t,” the 49-year-old filmmaker said.Guadagnino made it clear that he would never cast an actor on the basis on his sexuality as his method is to search the character in an artiste.“If I have to cast what people think is the real thing for a role, I wouldn’t be able to cast. I cannot cast a gay man to play Oliver. I have to cast Oliver to play Oliver because the identities of gay men are as multiple as the flowers in the realm of earth. “So, there is not a gay identity. One person who is gay is completely different to another person who is gay,” he added. Guadagnino is currently promoting his HBO miniseries We Are Who We Are, which will debut on the network on October 9.
The Union government has formed a 25-member development council to build a robust supply chain for the footwear and leather industry that would make the sector competitive in both domestic and export markets, two officials familiar with the matter said.The council is set up as per the directive of the Union minister for commerce and industry Piyush Goyal, who is taking specific measures to promote 20 sectors, including footwear, leather, furniture, agro-chemicals, ready-to-eat food, steel, textiles, electric vehicles, automobile components, sports goods, and toys, the officials said requesting anonymity.Goyal on July 27 had said though initially, the government had initially identified 12 industrial sectors to focus upon, later they have been expanded to 20 for scaling up investments and leveraging the country’s competitive edge.Also Read: Retail inflation grew at 6.7% in AugustThe Development Council for Footwear and Leather industry is formed to improve competitiveness and transform the sector by supporting it through various schemes and favourable trade policies, the officials said.The council is headed by a chairman, who is a representative of the industry. A joint secretary in the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) is its member secretary and other members are drawn from various government bodies and trade, one of the officials said.The council is represented by the Union ministry of textiles, the Director General Foreign Trade (DGFT), the ministry of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), the National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT), the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), the Footwear Design and Development Institute (FDDI), the Council for Leather Exports (CLE) and some leading companies, he added.Also Read: To take on China, boost local defence capabilitiesThe government had constituted a similar group to promote the bicycle industry on November 15 last year.DPIIT, which is an arm of the commerce and industry ministry, had formed the development council for bicycle for vision planning in design, engineering and manufacturing of lighter, smarter, value- added, safe and faster premium bicycles, which are comparable with global standards for exports and also for the domestic market, a second official said.A commerce and industry ministry spokesperson confirmed the development.“The Development Council for Footwear and Leather Industry has been established for the formulation and implementation of promotional and developmental measures for the growth of labour-intensive footwear and leather sectors in the country,” he said.Development councils are formed for promotion and growth of identified sectors.The formation of the council for the footwear and leather sector is in line with the Industrial (Development and Regulation) Act, 1951, the officials said. The government is also providing duty protection to these sectors from dumping of Chinese products, they said.While presenting the Union budget on February 1 this year, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said the unhindered imports of goods under free trade agreements (FTAs) were hurting domestic industries, particularly MSMEs and such imports required stringent checks.She had announced hikes in customs duty on items such as footwear and furniture in a bid to protect them from imports, particularly from China.The budget had raised import duty on footwear from 25% to 35%.DK Aggarwal, president, PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the council would act as an enabler for the domestic footwear and leather industry to become globally competitive and also provide a boost to domestic manufacturers through more job creation.“It will help the Indian footwear and leather industry in exploring new market opportunities in the global arena and strengthen its supply chain abroad, especially in top export destinations amid the hard times because of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak,” he said.Mohit Singla, chairman, Trade Promotion Council of India (TPIC), said the move is aimed at reducing imports. “The Development Council for Leather and Footwear Industry will provide a big boost to the domestic sector by bringing all stakeholders under one roof in a bid to establish synergies in both representations and policy formulations,” he said.
Actor Akshay Kumar found just the perfect throwback picture to post on the 18th birthday of his son, Aarav. Akshay took to Twitter to share a picture of Aarav and himself celebrating Holi.The photo shows Akshay holding Aarav in his arms and both of them are seen drenched in colours of Holi. Akshay wrote in the caption about Aarav’s big heart and how he cannot believe how much his son has grown. “Can’t believe this day has come.

Here is something I had written for you once and to keep loosening the strings and finally cutting them off this year has not been easy,” she wrote.Counting the things that she has learned over the years,Twinkle wrote, “All these years you have been as much my teacher as I have been yours. I learned optimism, kindness and wonder from you as I taught you maths, a few manners and how to switch the lights off when you leave the room.”“But looking at you growing up and listening to you repeatedly tell me how much you are looking forward to your independence, I have started realizing that when you finally leave my home, my world and step into your own, my lights will go off automatically and my world will be filled with a bleak darkness. Though whenever you return for a visit, I will light numerous diyas and pretend that this is not a permanent power failure; we are just celebrating Diwali,” she added.Concluding the emotional note, Twinkle said that she is already missing the little boy Aarav was and added, “I am already missing the little boy you were but am so proud of the man you have become. #MamaBear #MoustacheMusketeers.”Twinkle also shared a glimpse of his birthday celebration with family that featured Akshay, Twinkle, Aarav along with sister Nitara. The sweet picture captured all of them as they all sported a makeshift moustache.(With PTI inputs)
The Mumbai Police have dismissed reports that Sushant Singh Rajput’s former manger Disha Salian’s last call was to the police before her death. A Mumbai Police official has reportedly said that the celebrity manager had called her friend before her death. Disha had died a week before the death of the Chhichhore actor.According to ANI, a Mumbai Police official has said that the last call from Disha Salian’s phone was to her friend Ankita. Rubbishing the rumours, he said, “The claims that she tried to dial 100 the last time, is false.”The last call from Disha Salian's phone was made to her friend Ankita. The claims that she tried to dial 100 the last time, is false: Mumbai Police official #SushantSinghRajput's former manager Disha Salian was found dead on June 8 in Mumbai. — ANI (@ANI) September 18, 2020Last month, the Mumbai Police initiated an inquiry into the complaint filed by Disha’s father about the rumours allegedly being spread about his daughter’s death. Based on the complaint filed by Disha’s father Satish Salian, the Malvani police launched an inquiry and the process of recording statements is on, a Mumbai Police official said.Disha had died on June 8 after allegedly jumping off the 14th floor of a building in Mumbai’s Malad. An accidental death case was registered in the alleged suicide. On June 14, Rajput was found dead in his apartment in Mumbai.Her father had recently given a written complaint to the police, stating that “derogatory” posts and forwards were being shared by people that defamed his deceased daughter and his family. In his complaint, he had also alleged that the “news about her (Disha’s) involvement with any politician or attending parties with big names of the film fraternity, rape and murder are all stories cooked up by media people just to sell it to channels and these stories hold no truth.” Disha’s father had also requested the police to take action against the people concerned for their “insensitive act” towards his family.“The Malvani police, who are probing the case of Disha’s death, have also started an inquiry into the complaint filed by her father. Accordingly, statements of a few persons are being recorded in this connection,” the police official said. The police also made an appeal to the people to come forward with any evidence or information linked to the case.(With ANI inputs)
Ironically, this year has reminded me of both why I became a journalist, and why I sometimes think of dumping this profession and moving onto other things.If that sounds confusing, let me explain.I spent close to four months travelling across India, from Ladakh to Kerala, reporting on the Covid-19 pandemic, its humanitarian and economic consequences, its medical ramifications and its resultant social and psychological churn. On this 24,000-kilometre journey, on the ground as an old-fashioned reporter, sometimes without food or a place to stay, I relived the passion and hunger that first drew me to this job more than two decades ago.Like many of my colleagues, my later years in television, as a prime-time anchor, had dulled me, made my mind stale, chipped away at my energy and frankly, bored me. So, when my reporting on the pandemic drew questions about whether this was Barkha 2.0, I turned around and said that this was Barkha 1.0 who had lost bits of her core self somewhere along the way. It felt wonderful to reclaim news. It felt even more gratifying that there were so many people who responded so well to hard-nosed reportage.My old medium, television (I am now the editor of a digital video platform), did not cover itself in glory during the pandemic. As the biggest exodus of Indians since Partition took place, television was missing for nearly the first two months. Its more benign stars were either lazy or fearful or both. They did not stir out of the studios or their homes till much later. Its worst offenders sat inside too, and then looked for ways to turn the coronavirus into some sort of Hindu-Muslim claptrap. The pandemic has been consistently reported only by newspaper reporters, local stringers, some extremely brave photographers and a handful of digital journalists. On TV, you only got the formulaic talk shows, sometimes banal, sometimes dangerous for the poison they spewed.But nothing has, as dramatically, underscored the death of journalism as the coverage of the Sushant Singh Rajput tragedy. I don’t watch television news and, so, whatever I know is from online snippets released by various channels. Nor do I know anything about the protagonists involved. I did one interview with Susan Walker, a Mumbai-based therapist who treated the actor and who reached out to me through a professional acquaintance. It was a complicated decision for me to broadcast her assessment because it was evident that she was breaching patient privilege when she told me that Rajput was bipolar. I finally decided to air her statement because she told me that she feared more lives were at risk because of the toxicity of the media circus and it was her “duty” to speak.Subsequently, I have mostly stayed away from it all for a number of reasons. First, in the age of Covid-19, a damaged economy and a seriously precarious situation with China, this should not be a news priority. Then there is the invasiveness, the misogyny, the gossip and rumour masquerading as reportage and the sheer idiocy of it all. WhatsApp chats have been leaked to the studios, with various sides using the leaked content to make a point that suits their client. Even the so-called enlightened TV channels, whose anchors tweet daily about how they are above the story, have spent hours of video-time on their digital platforms covering it. Not one person has paused to wonder about the ethics of using these private conversations in the public domain. Not one of these journalists who so sanctimoniously judge everyone else would be willing for their own WhatsApp exchanges to be released for the world to scrutinise.I don’t know if Rajput killed himself or was killed. I have not followed the twists and turns of the case. I barely know the names of the protagonists. And, of course, I hope anyone who is guilty is punished.But there is something sordid and dangerous in the way this issue has been unpacked. Even those who argue that they are offering a counter-narrative to the media vilification of Rhea Chakraborty have become participants and traders in the same sort of tawdry content. We are now spending hours of air time on people’s private lives, break-ups, relationship woes and the supposed friction between girlfriends and parents. It’s unlikely that we would be willing to talk of any of this stuff when it comes to ourselves, if ever asked. The hypocrisy all around is staggering. Wherever I go, people complain about what they see on television. Yet, if you are lapping this up because it’s random entertainment or from morbid fascination, you are enablers. It isn’t just Rajput who died; it’s also television news media.And who is responsible for this murder? Or should I say, abetment to suicide?Barkha Dutt is an award-winning journalist and authorThe views expressed are personal
Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday asked the basic shiksha (basic education) department to recruit 31,661 assistant teachers within a week as the state government was committed to providing enough jobs and employment opportunities to the youth, said a statement from the chief minister’s office.A state government spokesperson said the basic shiksha department had conducted a recruitment examination on January 6, 2019, for filling 69,000 vacant posts of assistant teachers. According to a government order of January 7, 2019, the state government fixed 65% as the minimum percentage of marks for appointment of general category candidates and 60% for backward and other reserved classes of candidates.मुख्यमंत्री श्री @myogiadityanath जी ने बेसिक शिक्षा विभाग में 31,661 सहायक अध्यापकों की भर्ती प्रक्रिया को एक सप्ताह में पूरा करने के निर्देश दिए हैं।उन्होंने कहा है कि प्रदेश सरकार युवाओं को नौकरी सहित रोजगार के पर्याप्त अवसर उपलब्ध कराने के लिए कृतसंकल्पित है। — Yogi Adityanath Office (@myogioffice) September 19, 2020After this, some candidates moved the Allahabad high court. Later, the high court gave its verdict in favour of the state government while hearing the main writ petition ‘Ramsharan Maurya vs state government’.On May 21, the high court ordered that, barring the assistant teachers’ posts held by shiksha mitras, the remaining vacancies should be filled.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called Thursday on governments not to “throw away” economic stimulus funds by supporting fossil fuel industries that contribute to global warming.Speaking at a virtual conference on climate change, Guterres noted that countries have “a choice of two paths” as they mobilise trillions of dollars of taxpayers’ money for economic recovery in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.“We can either throw away money on the fossil fuels of the past. That is the road to more pollution,” he said. “Or we can invest in the technologies of the future, renewable energy, nature-based solutions, sustainable transport and green technologies.” “Only one of these paths is rational,” he said.The UN chief noted that large investors are already pulling their money out of heavily polluting industries, especially coal.“Without taxpayer subsidies they are bankrupt enterprises,” he said, claiming that building new renewable energy plants is already cheaper than continuing to operate almost two-fifths of the world’s existing coal-fired plants.Several countries, including coal-reliant Germany, have recently agreed to phase out the use of coal for electricity because of the vast amounts of carbon dioxide produced from burning it.In the United States, numerous coal-fired power plants have been shut down in recent years since 2010 and none of the nation’s energy companies are building a new one, despite U.S. President Donald Trump’s stated support for the coal industry.Guterres’ appeal to governments to stop subsidizing fossil fuel companies was echoed by actor and former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who helped organise the Austrian World Summit in Vienna.“When you hear that government plans to spend stimulus money bailing out fossil fuels, we must ask ourselves: if investors aren’t supporting those declining companies, why should taxpayers?,” Schwarzenegger said by video link from Los Angeles. “Governments must realize what the smart money knows instinctively: don’t invest in the past.” Efficient uses of money would include making buildings more energy-efficient and weatherproof, installing energy-efficiency appliances, cars using alternative fuels, and planting trees, he said.Since leaving political office in 2011, the Austrian-American actor has devoted time to environmental causes. A Republican, he has sparred with President Trump over climate issues.The meeting also heard a video appeal from Ugandan climate activist Vanessa Nakate, who called for the need to preserve the Congo rainforest from destruction.“Use your voice to speak about the Congo rainforest, because millions of people heavily depend on its existence,” she said.Jane Goodall, the pioneering conservationist, cited the pandemic as a warning for what can happen when humans treat the environment with disregard.“To a large extent we brought this (pandemic) on ourselves, by our disrespecting nature and disrespecting animals,” she said. “We’ve created conditions which make it easy for pathogens to jump from an animal to a person.” “We need to rethink our relationship with the natural world,” Goodall added. “We need to get together to somehow develop a new green economy and perhaps we need to think of a new definition of what it means to be successful in this life.”
As many 180 students of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) got job offers from different companies at the varsity’s online job fair with the highest offer being a Rs 10 lakh per annum package.Speaking to ANI, Saad Hameed, training and placement officer of the university said that around 23 companies took part in the event and that the highest job offer this year was of Rs 10,00,000.“This was our first online job fair due to the pandemic. Around 23 firms took part in it. There were 180 job offers in different courses. While Rs 10,00,000 package was the highest, several students got Rs 6,00,000package. We had prepared our students before interviews, which proved fruitful.”Arbab Ahmed, a student said, “I got job offers from three companies including BYJU’s. They have offered me Rs 10,00,000 package. I got all offers through the university. I am thankful that at a time when people are not getting jobs and businesses are affected, I got these offers.“ I did a Bachelor of Commerce from here. The AMU organised a job fair which began on August 10. I had also applied to BYJU’S and got a Rs 10,00,000 job offer. There were four rounds of interviews by the company,” added Harpreet Kaur, another student.
A whistleblower complaint filed in the US has sparked calls for a federal probe after it was alleged that an Indian-descent gynecologist had conducted mass hysterectomies on immigrants without their full understanding and consent at a privately-run detention centre in the state of Georgia.The complaint, filed by an employee of the detention centre, did not identify him. But lawyers representing the victims have named the doctor as Mahendra Amin, according to US media reports.“We are aware of the whistleblower’s allegations as they relate to Dr Amin and we vehemently deny them,” said Scott Grubman, the doctor’s attorney, in a statement. “We look forward to all of the facts coming out and are confident that, once they do, Dr Amin will be cleared of any wrongdoing.”Amin, 68, is an obstetrics and gynecology specialist. Prism, the news website that first reported the whistleblower complaint, said he is based in Douglas, Georgia and is affiliated with Coffee Regional Medical Center, which has since removed references to Amin from its website.According to reports, Amin studied medicine at the Government Medical College of South Gujarat University in Surat, India, and also interned there at a hospital.On Wednesday, 173 Democratic members of the House of Representatives wrote to the US department of homeland security, demanding an investigation into the whistleblower’s complaint.Pramila Jayapal, Indian-American congresswoman who initiated the joint letter along with senior party leaders, said, “It appears that there may be at minimum 17 to 18 women who were subjected to unnecessary medical gynecological procedures from just this one doctor, often without appropriate consent or knowledge, and with the clear intention of sterilisation.”Dawn Wooten, a licensed nurse employed by Irwin County Detention Center (ICDC) operated by private prison company, LaSalle Corrections, had filed the whistleblower complaint through Project South, a non-profit, with the inspector general of the department of homeland security on Monday. Wooten’s complaint alleged the conduct of mass hysterectomies amid rampant disregard for Covid-19 guidelines and unsanitary conditions at the facility.Project South said it learnt about the hysterectomies in interviews with multiple inmates. One of them reportedly confirmed, “A lot of women here go through a hysterectomy.” Also, some women subjected to the procedure reportedly seemed “confused” why they were made to undergo it.Wooten’s account, in her own words, is chilling. “Everybody he sees has a hysterectomy, just about everybody. He’s even taken out the wrong ovary on a young lady,” Wooten reportedly said, recalling a particular case. “She (the victim) was supposed to get her left ovary removed because it had a cyst. He took out the right one. She was upset, she had to go back to take out the left ovary and she wound up with a total hysterectomy.“She wants children. So she has to go back home now and tell her husband that she can’t bear kids... she said she was not all the way out under anesthesia and heard him (the doctor) tell the nurse that he took out the wrong ovary.”The outrage sparked by the allegations was fuelled by a well-documented and alarming history of sterilisation of people of colour in the US aimed at preventing the rapid growth of their population.
Nestled in the Himalayas atop the Mussoorie Hills is the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration, the alma mater of thousands of civil servants holding every conceivable senior position in the labyrinthine bureaucracy of the Indian State. Year after year, hundreds of successful candidates of the highly competitive civil services examination get inducted into government service at the hallowed precincts of this prestigious institution, fondly known as the Academy.Weary after 72 hours of journey by rail and road and the last 2km on foot as I entered the premises of Charleville at the centre of the Academy complex, I did not feel excited, but felt exhausted. As I looked around quizzically, a diminutive, bespectacled figure approached me, introduced himself as Narayanan, administrative officer, and politely asked me my name and to which service I belonged. He took me to his office nearby, went through formalities on paper and directed his staff to take me to the assigned room and familiarise me with the place and its ways.Among the probationers, I discovered that there were more than a dozen Malayalees, including three women. We made friends easily and forged a Mallu gang that became fairly conspicuous after the Onam celebrations we organised with gusto.Though life at the academy was fairly disciplined, starting early with horse riding or physical training and stretching late into the evening, there was not much of heavy learning. The probationers busied themselves in getting to know each other, learning government service etiquettes, equipping themselves with their service paraphernalia or just taking leisurely walks in the salubrious surroundings.Trekking up to Landour for savouring genuine masala dosa and filter coffee at a Tamilian dhaba was a regular Sunday exercise for many. For us from a rural background not used even to piped water and electrified homes, it was the first opportunity, both exciting and embarrassing, to get exposed to the urban lifestyle, including the luxury of three meals at fixed hours served by waiters in uniform.For the IAS and IPS probationers, cadre allotment was the main concern which they awaited with bated breath as it determined in which state they would be called upon to live and serve nearly the whole of their official career. Allotment of officers to state cadres was determined by various considerations, the most important being the availability of vacancies in a state and the insider-outsider ratio which ensured that roughly half of officers allotted to a state in a given year were from outside.Despite occasional aberrations, the insider-outsider formula in its core has survived, protecting the all-India character of our premier services. The vision of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the father of All India Services, about their role in governance has somewhat diminished over the years. Yet the concerns that inspired him and the constitutionally sanctified structure he succeeded in establishing for addressing them, continue to be valid. The symbolism of a Telugu officer serving in Kashmir and a Mallu in Mizoram is as significant as the underlying principle fostering national integration, reflecting unity in diversity.The curriculum of the foundational course at the Academy was designed to familiarise probationers with the fundamentals of our constitutional democracy, socio-cultural history and institutions of governance. It was more of a rite of initiation than hardcore training in any specialised area of governance.Reflecting on my five decades as a civil servant, I can vouch that the social capital the probationers accumulate stand them in good stead later while they hold positions of authority and responsibility more than in-depth knowledge of the income tax laws or Civil Procedure Code. akuttynair@gmail.comThe writer has served as Punjab chief secretary and principal secretary to former prime minister Manmohan Singh
Hurricane Sally lumbered ashore near the Florida-Alabama line with 105 mph (165 kph) winds and rain measured in feet, not inches, swamping homes and forcing the rescue of hundreds of people as it pushed inland for what could be a slow and disastrous drenching across the Deep South.Moving at an agonizing 3 mph, or about as fast as a person can walk, the storm made landfall at 4:45 a.m. local time Wednesday close to Gulf Shores, Alabama, about 30 miles from Pensacola. It accelerated to a light jog as it battered the Pensacola and Mobile, Alabama, metropolitan areas encompassing nearly 1 million people.It cast boats onto land or sank them at the dock, flattened palm trees, peeled away roofs, blew down signs and knocked out power to more than a half-million homes and businesses. A replica of Christopher Columbus’ ship the Nina that had been docked at the Pensacola waterfront was missing, police said.Sally tore loose a barge-mounted construction crane, which then smashed into the new Three Mile Bridge over Pensacola Bay, causing a section of the year-old span to collapse, authorities said. The storm also ripped away a large section of a fishing pier at Alabama’s Gulf State Park on the very day a ribbon-cutting had been scheduled following a USD 2.4 million renovation.By the afternoon, authorities in Escambia County, which includes Pensacola, said at least 377 people had been rescued from flooded areas. More than 40 people trapped by high water were brought to safety within a single hour, including a family of four found in a tree, Sheriff David Morgan said.Authorities in Pensacola said 200 National Guard members would arrive Thursday to help. Officials also announced a three-day dusk-to-dawn curfew in the county, where the storm turned some Pensacola streets into white-capped rivers for a time.By early afternoon, Sally had weakened into a tropical storm, with winds down to 70 mph (110 kph), but the worst may be yet to come, with heavy rain expected into Thursday as the storm pushes inland over Alabama and into Georgia. For much of the day, it was moving at just 5 mph (7 kph), concentrating the amount of rain dropped on any one place.Morgan estimated thousands more will need to flee rising waters in the coming days. County officials urged residents to rely on text messages for contacting family and friends to keep cellphone service open for 911 calls.“There are entire communities that we’re going to have to evacuate,” the sheriff said. “It’s going to be a tremendous operation over the next several days.” West of Pensacola, power poles leaned halfway over in Perdido Key, Florida, as Joe Mirable arrived at his real estate business to find the two-story building shattered, its contents scatted on the ground.Digging through the ruins, Mirable pointed out a binder labeled “Hurricane Action Plan.” “I think the professionals got this one wrong,” he said before the wind blew away his hat.More than 2 feet of rain (61 centimetres) was recorded near Naval Air Station Pensacola, and nearly 3 feet (1 metre) of water covered streets in downtown Pensacola, the National Weather Service reported.“It’s not common that you start measuring rainfall in feet,” said forecaster David Eversole. “Sally’s moving so slowly, so it just keeps pounding and pounding and pounding the area with tropical rain and just powerful winds. It’s just a nightmare.” It was the second hurricane to hit the Gulf Coast in less than three weeks and the latest blow in one of the busiest hurricane seasons ever recorded, so frenetic that forecasters have nearly run through the alphabet of storm names with 2 1/2 months still to go. At the start of the week, Sally was one of a record-tying five storms churning simultaneously in the Atlantic, strung out like charms on a bracelet.Like the wildfires raging on the West Coast, the onslaught of hurricanes has focused attention on climate change, which scientists say is causing slower, rainier, more powerful and more destructive storms.An emergency crew rescued two people on Dauphin Island, Alabama, after the hurricane ripped the roof off their home and the rest of the house began to crumble.“As things started to peel off and fall apart, they got scared and called for assistance,” Mayor Jeff Collier said. He said no one was injured.In Orange Beach, Alabama, the wind blew out the walls in one corner of a condominium building, exposing the interiors of condos on at least five floors, video posted online showed. At least 50 people were rescued from flooded homes and taken to shelters, Mayor Tony Kennon said.“We got a few people that we just haven’t been able to get to because the water is so high,” Kennon said. “But they are safe in their homes. As soon as the water recedes, we will rescue them.”
Secretary, department of space and chairman, space commission K Sivan on Saturday said Gaganyaan programme, the indigenous mission that would take Indian astronauts to space, was extremely important for India as it will boost science and technology capability of the country.Addressing the 15th convocation function of the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad (IIIT-A) and the institute’s first ever convocation to be held online on Saturday, Sivan highlighted the importance of the Indian crewed orbital spacecraft that will launch a manned mission to space, making the country fourth in line to have sent a human to space.Speaking as the chief guest, Sivan said starting a space programme in a country like India in 1960’s was one big crazy idea. But Vikram Sarabhai foresaw the potential of space technology in transforming India. When the whole world was using space for military domination, Sarabhai thought that for a country like India with its immense size and diversity, the space technology platform is the only suitable platform for fast-track development. And the results are here for all of us to see.“Each moment in our lives in one way or the other is connected with space technology. Today when we embark on expanding the scope of India’s space program, we are actually realising the vision of Sarabhai”, he added.He also said that the reforms like allowing private sector, start-ups as well as academia to undertake space missions thereby bringing in innovation, technical diversity and human resource development had immense potential to improve the bottom line of space industry in India.The top scientist said that despite the progress made over the last half a century, we still had unresolved issues of reducing poverty and hunger, providing good health services and sanitation, adequate supply of clean drinking water, providing quality education to people, etc. He called upon the students to work wholeheartedly in solving these problems.As many as 403 students were awarded different degrees at convocation function. Besides this, the institute also awarded 23 medals to meritorious at the convocation. Ten research scholars were also conferred PhD degrees.IIIT-A director Prof Nagabhusan shared that of the 196 students, who had opted for campus placement support, 191 had been already placed. A whopping 83 companies had visited the campus, offering average salary package of Rs 22.5 lakh per annum.Vaibhav Srivastava was awarded the Chairman’s Gold Medal for 2020 for his outstanding performance. Vaibhav Srivastava, Shivam Fialok and Simran Gill were awarded Gold, Silver and Bronze Medal respectively for BTech (IT). In BTech (ECE), Shravya Pandey was awarded gold, Srishti Agrawal the silver and Gauranshi Nili the bronze medal respectively.Dr TCM Pillay memorial gold medal for BTech (IT) was awarded to Garima Chadha, Nobel Laureate prof Claude Cohen Tannoudji gold medal to BTech student Tanya Agarwal, Prof Dr Ing Mathias Kleiner gold medal to BTech student Niharika Shrivastava and prof Joelle Cohen Tannoudji gold medal to MTech bio-informatics student Shivani Gupta during the convocation.All outstation guests, students and members of various bodies including the board of governors attended the event online while those present in the campus attended it physically from the IIIT-A auditorium while adhering to all social distancing norms and wearing facemasks.
Shahid Kapoor cannot wait to return to the sets of Jersey. He took to Instagram to share a throwback video in which he smashes a shot during net practice. “Can’t wait to get back. Missing my boys @rajivmehra1988 n @harshuln #jersey,” he captioned it.In the video, Shahid is seen dressed in cricket whites as he smacks the ball. His skills got a thumbs up from fast bowler Mohammad Shami, who commented, “Well played.” The actor’s mother, Neelima Azeem, also complimented him and wrote, “Shot,” followed by applause and kiss emojis.Fans also showered praise on Shahid. “Wat a shot!! Perfect on drive with high elbow treat to watch,” one wrote. “Replacement for suresh raina found,” another commented. “Nd we can’t wait for #JERSEY to see ur legendary performance SK ! much love,” a third wrote.Shahid was shooting for Jersey in Chandigarh when the coronavirus pandemic struck the country. On March 14, he announced that filming was stalled for safety reasons. “At a time like this it is our social responsibility to do everything in our capacity to curb the spread of this virus. Team #Jersey is suspending shoot so as to enable all unit members to be with their families and in the safety of their homes. Be responsible. Stay safe,” he posted on Twitter.Jersey, directed by Gowtam Tinnanuri, is a remake of the Telugu film of the same name. Shahid will be seen as a former cricketer who returns to the game in his mid-30s. The film revolves around how he makes a smashing comeback, despite age not being on his side.Nani, who played the lead role in the Telugu version of Jersey, said he was looking forward to the remake starring Shahid. “I am super happy and I am really looking forward, like everyone else, to see what the response will be. It is going to be such a big release across the country. I want to see how people will receive the film,” he had earlier told Hindustan Times.

IPL’s two most successful teams Chennai Super Kings and Mumbai Indians will face each other in the curtain raiser of IPL 2020 on Saturday in Abu Dhabi. CSK’s West Indian all-rounder Dwayne Bravo has a chance to make the occasion more special by etching his name on the Indian Premier League record books.Bravo is on the cusp of breaking Ravichandran Ashwin’s record and become the highest wicket-taker for CSK. The West Indies all-rounder needs just 3 wickets to go past the former CSK off-spinner who will play his trade for Delhi Capitals in this IPL.Bravo, who is currently observing a mandatory seven day quarantine in UAE, has 118 wickets to his name for CSK in 103 matches. Ashwin, on the other hand, 120 wickets in 121 matches.With 147 wickets Bravo is the 5th highest wicket taker in IPL. He is 3 wickets short to complete 150 wickets.Bravo has won the Purple Cap with Chennai Super Kings twice in 2013 and 2015. His 32 wickets in IPL 2013 is the most by any bowler in a single edition of the tournament.Great record against MIBravo, who recently became the first bowler to claim 500 T20 wickets, also has a very impressive track record against four-time champions Mumbai Indians.The right-arm medium pacer has taken 28 wickets in 19 matches against Mumbai Indians – the most by any bowler in the IPL.Dwayne Bravo’s bowling average of 19.25 is the 2nd best against Mumbai Indians in IPL among the bowlers who have bowled 250 or more balls.From the batting perspective, Bravo who had single-handedly won a game for CSK in the last IPL against MI, needs 73 runs from becoming the 8th player with 1000 runs for CSK in IPL.
Updated: Sep 15, 2020 11:28 ISTIndia captain Virat Kohli has achieved numerous plaudits. He led India to first-ever Test series win in Australia in 2018-19. Kohli also has maintained a staggering winning percentage across all formats as captain, and is regarded as one of the most inspiring leaders across the world. But in the Indian Premier League, Kohli has not been able to lead Royal Challengers Bangalore to a single trophy yet.With the tournament shifted to the UAE, cricketing pundits believe that the RCB may have a chance this year as RCB bowlers will enjoy bowling amid slow and turning conditions offered by the pitches in the country. The pundits also believe that RCB have made some good additions and look more of a balanced squad this year.IPL 2020 Full CoverageOn being asked about the same observations, former India cricketer and two-time IPL winning captain Gautam Gambhir said that if RCB squad lacked balance before, then Kohli should have addressed it in the previous seasons.“The first thing is that Virat Kohli is the one who has been captaining RCB since 2016. So if the balance was not there earlier, then Virat Kohli should have got more involved,” Gambhir said during an interaction on Star Sports.The former left-handed batsman also said that he still feels that RCB looks a more batting-heavy unit, but added that the bowlers will certainly enjoy bowling in UAE pitches as compared to Chinnaswamy stadium.“I still feel that RCB look a little batting-heavy. But one thing that you will see a little different is that the bowlers will be happy because they will not have to play 7 matches at the Chinnaswamy Stadium. You will be playing in Dubai and Abu Dhabi which probably have bigger grounds, wickets are not as flat as Chinnaswamy. It is always difficult to judge the bowlers from Chinnaswamy’s point of view.“India’s smallest ground and the flattest wicket is in Chinnaswamy, so bowlers will be happier and you might see a better performance from bowlers like Umesh Yadav and Navdeep Saini,” Gambhir said.Gambhir also added that Chris Morris is the player who can add depth to RCB unit in both batting and bowling. “Chris Morris provides balance to the RCB squad, a quality all-rounder although he has not played much cricket. He can be a finisher as a batsman and can also give you 4 overs and bowl at the death.“They have Washington Sundar and Yuzvendra Chahal as well but it will have to be seen which 4 overseas players RCB picks in their XI,” Gambhir signed off.
Actor Kangana Ranaut has once again spoken about Sara Ali Khan’s alleged relationship with later actor Sushant Singh Rajput. Kangana has said that Sushant was openly ridiculed in film circles and a concerted character assassination done.Previously, Kangana had said in a tweet that Sushant’s break up with Sara was the reason he fell for a ‘vulture’, referring to his girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty. “News of Sushant Singh Rajput and Sara affair was all over the media, apparently they were even sharing a room during their outdoor, why these fancy Nepotism kids show dreams to vulnerable outsiders and then publicly dump them? No wonder he fell for a vulture post that,” she had tweeted. “I believe Sara must’ve loved him he wasn’t a fool to fall for a girl whose affection isn’t genuine but she must have been under pressure, what I shared with Hrithik was genuine at that point I still have no doubts about it why suddenly he became so hostile is still a mystery to me,” she had added. Sara made her film debut in 2018 with Sushant in Kedarnath.Now, in an interview to Times Now, Kangana said that even Sara’s stepmother, Kareena Kapoor told Sara not to date ‘her first hero’. “When he was dating Sara, they made sure they broke up. Even Kareena went on record to say that don’t date your first hero, so they openly did character assassination of him, ridiculed him. When that boy was completely cornered, then another group of emotional vultures came and they did what they did,” she said. Kareena had made the remark on an episode of Koffee With Karan.Kangana said in the interview that the same group that ostracised Sushant from Bollywood, has been targeting her as well. “First of all like I said, the movie mafia which tortured Sushant, banned him, I have already spoken about them. The production houses that are targeting me, they have their own pet media who tried to assassinate his character, called him a rapist and cornered him,” she said.Kangana arrived in Mumbai on September 9 when the BMC tore down parts of her office due to alleged illegal construction. She has been warring against the Maharashtra state government, the Shiv Sena, and now even Urmila Matondkar. After Urmila’s recent comments against her, Kangana launched a personal attack at the senior actor, calling her a soft porn star.
Madhuri Dixit shared a video of herself spending quality time with her husband Dr Shriram Nene and their sons, Arin and Ryan. The four of them were seen planting saplings and setting up their kitchen garden.“Together we plant, together we see it grow,” a line of text in the video read. The clip also shows the result of their efforts - little shoots growing after a few days. “Setting up my kitchen garden together with the family. Never stop trying your hand at something new and interesting. #ExperiencesOverThings,” Madhuri captioned the video posted on her Instagram account.Fans showered love. “U look amazing with your family God bless,” one wrote. “Best family ever. stay blessed ..u give so much of positivity on social media. thank u for that ma’am,” another commented. “It’s so amazing and innovative,” a third wrote.Madhuri has been sharing glimpses of her everyday activities on social media, whether it is making modaks on Ganesh Chaturthi or playing with her pet dog. Her husband recently shared a picture of them in the kitchen and wrote, “All good when you are cooking together!”In May this year, Madhuri and Arin performed at the virtual fundraiser concert, I For India. She surprised everyone by singing Ed Sheeran’s Perfect while her son took over the piano.Madhuri was last seen on the big screen in Abhishek Varman’s period drama Kalank, which also starred Varun Dhawan, Alia Bhatt, Aditya Roy Kapur, Sonakshi Sinha and Sanjay Dutt. She recently released her first single, titled Candle.Earlier, in an interview with Hindustan Times, Madhuri opened up about keeping her family away from the media glare. “We are like any other normal family and thus, have managed to keep a low profile with my kids in the media. Fans also understand that for me some things are private and they will always be that way and they respect that. I don’t have to put every waking day of my life on social media. But for me, it is keeping in touch with them, letting them know what’s happening,” she said.
Governments’ failure to recognise the land rights of indigenous communities and their role in protecting biodiversity could lead to more coronavirus-like pandemics, researchers said on Tuesday.A study of more than 40 countries found many local people’s land claims were being ignored, amid increasing deforestation and wildlife exploitation, which may be contributing to a rise in diseases, like Covid-19, that pass from animals to humans.“Despite compelling evidence that indigenous peoples, local communities, and Afro-descendants protect most of the world’s remaining biodiversity, they are under siege from all sides,” said Andy White of the Rights and Resources Initiative (RRI).“Our work suggests the answer is to invest in the countries and communities that are ready to scale up land rights. Failure to do so puts at risk the health of the planet and all of its people,” White, the study’s co-author, said in a statement.The study by the RRI - an alliance of more than 150 organisations advocating for community land rights - comes ahead of a United Nations pledge expected to be agreed in 2021 to set aside 30% of the planet’s land and sea for conservation by 2030.Despite local people managing and protecting 50% of the area studied - which included Brazil, India, China, Kenya, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Indonesia - governments recognised only half of community land claims, RRI said.This needs to be addressed urgently, said researchers, as a growing number of zoonotic diseases – including Ebola, MERS, West Nile fever, Zika, SARS and Rift Valley fever – have recently jumped from animal hosts into the human population.The most dramatic example is the new coronavirus, which is believed to have emerged in a market in China last year after jumping the species barrier from the animal kingdom to infect humans. It has killed more than 930,000 people so far.Anthony Waldron, a conservation finance researcher based at Cambridge University, said securing indigenous peoples’ land rights was key to stemming the spread of such diseases.“If there is chaotic development in a forest where people and wildlife are coming more into contact with one another, then it’s only a matter of time before a virus jumps into the human population,” he told a virtual briefing.“If you don’t have defined land rights, you don’t know who owns what part and anyone can happily invade. If you have clearly defined land rights ... which indigenous groups can manage ... there is smaller risk those viruses can jump.”About 60% of known infectious diseases in humans and 75% of all emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic, largely due to the increased interaction between humans, animals and the environment, according to the United Nations.Most efforts to control zoonotic diseases have been reactive rather than proactive, said environmental experts, calling on governments to invest in public health, farm sustainability, end over-exploitation of wildlife and reduce climate change.
Rashid Khan has made a name for himself due to his consistent performances in the shortest format of the game. He plays in almost every T20 league around the world and is one of the first names on the team sheet. Even in the Indian Premier League, Sunrisers Hyderabad shelled out big bucks for him and they haven’t been disappointed. He has always helped raise the profile of cricket in Afghanistan.The nation now has a full-fledged cricket team that often challenges the top teams in the world. Rashid along with Mohammad Nabi, Mujeeb-ur-Rahman, and Gulbadin Naib have made the team a fighting outfit who regularly play in ICC tournaments.However, Rashid doesn’t just want to play the ICC tournaments. He wants to win them for his country. Rashid believes Afghanistan has the talent and skills to achieve the feat and only needs regular cricket against top nations to get there.“I think the biggest achievement (for Afghanistan) should be, right now, what the team is looking for, what the country is expecting is, to win the T20 World Cup,” Khan, the country’s biggest cricketer, said.The leg-break bowler was speaking to Ravichandran Ashwin during the show, DRS with Ash, hosted by the India off-spinner.“We have all the skills, talent, and we just need to have that belief in ourselves that we can do it. Talent-wise we are so good, we have the spinners, we have the fast bowlers, we have the batting skills as well. “But what took us down in that Test (against India) was our experience against big teams, because we didn’t play enough cricket with them.”Afghanistan became part of the ICC 16 years ago, produced some fine wins in limited-overs cricket, and won two of the four-Test matches they have played so far. One of the Test wins came against a far more experienced Bangladesh team.A little more than two years ago, in their first-ever Test outing, India beat Afghanistan by an innings and 262 runs at the Chinnaswami Stadium in Bengaluru. Recalling their maiden Test match, the Afghanistan captain said,“The biggest dream of the whole country was to be called a Full Member team and to play a Test game.“When we were playing against you guys in our first Test game, we didn’t know what we were doing. Everyone was just counting - I’m going to be the first one to hit a four, the first one to hit a six, the first one to take a single. “It wasn’t the best game for us, but there were so many things we learned.”He said the country needs to play more against bigger teams to become better.“The moment we play more series with them, we can become a better team. We are very famous for T20 players, but inshallah, that is a dream of mine and a dream of the country that one day we will win the T20 title and that will be the biggest achievement for Afghanistan cricket and for us as well,” Khan said.(with PTI inputs)
Updated: Sep 14, 2020 11:19 ISTAustralia pacer Pat Cummins says the 24-run loss to England in the second ODI here was “tough one to get your head around” with his team letting the hosts off the hook twice in the game. From 149 for eight, England went on to make 231 for nine on a surface where runs were hard to come by. Australia then made a good start before a dramatic collapse saw them slip from 144 for two in the run chase to be 207 all-out. The three-match series is now levelled at 1-1.“I’ll get my head around that tomorrow and have a bit of a look at the footage. On that wicket, for 40 overs it felt like a good length was the hardest to hit, and suddenly they started hitting them quite nicely,” said Cummins after the game on Sunday.“We’ll have a review. If we’d kept them down - those last 10 (overs) went for 80-odd, I think - we’re suddenly only chasing 200 and it’s a different game.“It’s a tough one to get your head around. I thought we bowled really well and then let them off the hook in the last 10 overs ... we gave them an extra 40 or 50 runs.” It was a slow surface which helped the spinners and Cummins said his team will have to improve its game on pitches like these, something it will encounter in the 2023 World Cup in India.“Something we always talk about in tournament play and World Cups is that towards the back end, you are likely to get these kind of wickets where spinners (will play a role) and you’re not getting 350 that you might get at the start of the tournament,” he said.“On a really good wicket, in your death bowling you go to yorkers or slower balls or bouncers. Here it’s tossing up what’s the hardest ball to hit - is it a yorker or maybe it’s top of the stumps?“Maybe you can keep the fields in for longer, the spinners might have more of an impact. I really enjoy it. It makes you think differently and try and solve problems,” he said.
Most observers do not have many expectations from the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc), and, indeed, the progress that the region has seen in bilateral or sub-regional cooperation over the last decade has not involved the association. But times are unprecedented, thanks to Covid-19.Like last year, Nepal, the current chair of Saarc, plans to host a meeting (virtual) of the Saarc council of ministers during the 75th Session of the UN General Assembly in the third week of September. Is there anything that these ministers can meaningfully do through Saarc to help reduce economic hardship and, through some quick wins, create hope for greater stability in the region?Despite its limitations, Saarc – if used effectively by Nepal and the council of ministers – may be able to add some value in the current turmoil, and, in the process, enhance its credibility and effectiveness.Perhaps Saarc’s most-important role right now would be to provide a platform for dialogue. South Asia is fraught with a trust deficit that runs across many bilateral relationships. Even convening can be treated with suspicion. When India convened a meeting of South Asian trade officials in April, Pakistan did not participate. On the other hand, when SAARC was involved in the convening, as in the leaders’ dialogue (proposed by India) in March, all countries took part. They were possibly more at ease than if India had convened. Similarly, when Pakistan took the initiative and organised a Saarc-convened meeting of health ministers, all members participated. So, the first order of business is for member states to use Saarc to convene an inclusive dialogue, because the dialogue is the starting point for any collaboration.The low share of intra-regional trade and investment in South Asia penalises its workers, consumers, and exporters. This piece suggests four specific areas where Nepal’s initiatives through Saarc can address the larger issues at stake. All four can be tabled and pursued simultaneously. And whether or not Saarc can nudge things along, the issues will remain, and failure to resolve them will reduce the economic opportunities for the people of South Asia.Direct trade between India and Pakistan has slowed to a trickle since India imposed 200% duties on imports from Pakistan in February 2019 (after the Pulwama attack), and Pakistan banned trade with India in August 2019 (after the passage of the J&K Reorganisation Bill). This has exacted a severe toll on the thousands of families dependent on bilateral trade, as documented by Afaq Husain and Nikita Singla of BRIEF.Through Saarc, if Nepal can bring all countries to the dialogue table to discuss trade, India and Pakistan might be willing to consider face-saving trade resumption on pre-2019 terms. Such face-saving could take the form of resuming trade subject to an annual certification by both sides to the effect that the other party has not taken actions prejudicial to its neighbour’s interest (the exact terminology and content can be decided between India and Pakistan).This is reminiscent of the United States’ annual renewal of “Most Favoured Nation” status (same terms as any other trading partner) to China, throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The resumption of trade between South Asia’s two largest economies will not only help the traders, porters, truckers and other stakeholders on the border, it will also impart some much-needed motivation to the rest of South Asia, which often feels weighed down by the acrimony between India and Pakistan.Afghanistan has long demanded that Pakistan allow it to import Indian goods via the Wagah-Attari border. Its trucks can currently transit across Pakistan and export to India via the Wagah border, as part of the Afghanistan Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement. But these trucks cannot bring back Indian imports and have to return empty to Afghanistan.In the spirit of a Covid détente, could Pakistan be persuaded to allow these Afghan trucks to take back Indian goods? To address its domestic constituencies, Pakistan could insist that the import load be no more than the export load, at least to begin with and review the experience after a few months. Still, it will nonetheless earn enormous goodwill from India and, especially, Afghanistan. Nepal could offer to appoint a neutral mediator via Saarc to resolve contentious issues. As in the earlier case, a solution here would have positive ramifications for the countries involved and Saarc’s self-confidence, achievements that would go beyond the bilateral Afghanistan-Pakistan trade relationship.E-commerce is a fruitful avenue to explore, given the Covid-19 induced increase in digitisation. A World Bank report (Unleashing E-Commerce for South Asian Integration) suggested ways of building on the informal intra-regional e-commerce that already exists. A practical and incremental approach is best suited to address the multiple hurdles. Issues include the lack of consumer access in some countries to foreign exchange for cross-border payments, and the absence of a predictable tariff regime for small value shipments, say up to a value of $100.Nepal can suggest that Saarc be used as a forum for countries to thrash out the core issues between themselves; the World Bank report’s suggestions can be a starting point. The goal would be to kick-start an e-commerce counterpart to the South Asian Free Trade Area, with preferences to products with an explicit local value-added content. The onus on certifying value-added should be placed on the e-commerce platforms. Should such digitally-enabled trade take off, it could help micro and small enterprises, among others, to access cross-border markets and thus gain a vital additional source of demand.To minimise Covid-19 induced disruption to trade, many countries have advanced on digitally-enabled trade simplification — a simple example is acceptance of electronic rules of origin certificates. Nepal can table some suggestions and perhaps help broker some agreed principles for trade clearances and simplification, many of which are already being implemented by individual countries like India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh. A recent paper by Prabir De for ESCAP has outlined some useful measures for digitising trade processes.South Asia will always exist as a geographical entity. If it is collaborative, workers, consumers, and exporters in the region will benefit, irrespective of advances in other regional groupings. There is an existing institution - Saarc- that is mandated to facilitate regional cooperation. Making Saarc more effective will be a win for everyone, especially the people of South Asia. There are some significant trade issues that, if even partially addressed, can help Saarc become more credible and effective.Is it wishful thinking? Perhaps. But times are not normal. That expands the boundary of the possible.Sanjay Kathuria is senior visiting fellow, Centre for Policy Research, and former lead economist, World BankThe views expressed are personal
Updated: Sep 17, 2020 08:35 ISTUrmila Matondkar has asked Kangana Ranaut to share the names of all the Bollywood stars with links to drug abuse. The Rangeela actor has also questioned the timing of her numerous interviews and why she has “problems with everybody in the industry.”Asking Kangana to reveal all she knows, Urmila said, “Where are the names? I would like Kangana to actually come forward and do us all a huge favour by giving out those name and call out those people. Let’s have it all out. I will be the first one to say thumbs up to you girl.”Urmila was talking to India Today, and further said, “You have to decide do you want to constantly play the victim card non-stop say main toh victim hun, victim hun, victim hun.”Questioning the timing of her explosive comments, including calling Urmila ‘a soft porn star’, Urmila said, “Everything that you have got today -- the name, the fame and the money -- is all thanks to Mumbai and the film industry. Why is it that you have not spoken about these things in the last so many years and are speaking about all this only in the last few months? The timing seems funny. Everything seems going a bit berserk.”Kangana had earlier claimed on Republic TV that “99% of Bollywoood stars consume drugs.” Urmila had recently slammed Kangana for talking ill of Mumbai and the entire film industry. Reacting to Urmila’s comments, Kangana told Times Now in an interview, “She isn’t known for acting for sure and is know for doing soft porn. If she can get a ticket, why won’t I get a ticket.”Kangana is back in headlines after she slammed veteran actor-turned politician Jaya Bachchan for her recent speech in the Parliament. Without taking any names, Jaya had criticised those who earn their livelihood in the entertainment industry and yet spoil its image by calling it a ‘gutter’.
Those who have collaborated with late actor Sushant Singh Rajput mostly have nice things to say about him. And Rajput’s Chhichhore (2019) co-star Saanand Verma is no different. He says we rarely see performers who have the quality to become every role they portray.“There was a method to his passion and performance. In Chhichhore, he was this happy and excited college goer, who later was shown as the father, worried about his child. Much like the character’s transition, you could also see the change in him in real life too, till he was playing the role. I think no one would’ve played Dhoni (M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story; 2016) as perfectly as he did,” says Verma.While working in Chhichhore, Verma adds that Rajput was “energetic and fun loving throughout” and his dedication and passion towards his craft were inspiring.“I’m not getting these talks around his mental health. Till the time I saw him, he was absolutely perfect. I never saw him behave in a certain way,” he shares, adding that something was amiss in Rajput’s life.Known for web shows Sacred Games, Apharan, and TV show Bhabiji Ghar Par Hain!, Verma adds, “You could feel that a phenomenal actor like him, who deserved much more, wasn’t getting his due. May be something might have happened between him and some influential people in Bollywood and they might have ganged up against him. But still he had ample work opportunities.”There is some unknown territory as far as Rajput’s death case is concerned that needs to be explored, feels Verma. But, the focus seems to be shifting.“Sad that some are using it to gain mileage, publicise their agenda, get TRPs… What’s happening right now is almost his character assassination. It’s being portrayed that he was into drugs and all. I’ve worked with him but never felt or seen anything. I absolutely condemn all that’s are happening around the case. Is this the first time we’ve come to know that drug consumption in Bollywood? I feel efforts are being made to hide something else. While doing that everything else is being blown out of proportion. I just hope the investigation finds out the truth,” he ends.Author tweets @Shreya_MJ
The Union government has formed a 25-member development council to build a robust supply chain for the footwear and leather industry that will make the sector competitive in both domestic and export markets, two officials said on Wednesday.The council has been set up as per the directive of commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal, who is taking specific measures to promote 20 sectors including footwear, leather, furniture, agro-chemicals, ready-to-eat food, steel, textiles, electric vehicles, auto-components, sports goods, and toys, the officials said on condition of anonymity.

The development council for footwear and leather industry has been formed to improve competitiveness and transform the sector through support of schemes and favourable trade policies, the officials said.The council is headed by a chairman, who is a representative of the industry. A joint secretary in the department for promotion of industry and internal trade is its member secretary and other members are drawn from various government bodies and trade. The council is represented by the ministry of textiles, the Director General Foreign Trade, the ministry of micro, small and medium enterprises, the National Institute of Fashion Technology, the Bureau of Indian Standards, the Footwear Design and Development Institute, the Council for Leather Exports and some leading companies, he added.

Updated: Sep 19, 2020 09:08 ISTTaiwan bid farewell on Saturday to late-president Lee Teng-hui, dubbed “Mr. Democracy” for ending autocratic rule in favour of free elections and championing Taiwan’s separate identity from China.Lee’s memorial service took place in the shadow of Chinese war games, as did his election as Taiwan’s first democratic leader in 1996. China claims the island as its own territory.Lee was president from 1988 to 2000.Lee’s greatest act of defiance was becoming Taiwan’s first democratically-elected president in March 1996, achieved with a landslide following eight months of intimidating war games and missile tests by China in waters around the island.Those events brought China and Taiwan to the verge of conflict, prompting the United States to send a carrier task force to the area in a warning to the Beijing government.On Friday, China carried out drills in the Taiwan Strait, including sending 18 fighter jets to buzz the island, as Beijing expressed anger at the visit of a senior U.S. official to Taipei, there for Lee’s memorial.Speaking at the memorial service in a chapel at a Taipei university, President Tsai Ing-wen said he had shaped the Taiwan of today.“Confronted with daunting international challenges, he skilfully led the people of Taiwan by promoting pragmatic diplomacy. Taiwan became synonymous with democracy and was catapulted onto the world stage. Because of this, President Lee came to be lauded as Mr. Democracy,” Tsai said.“Thanks to his efforts, Taiwan now shines as a beacon of democracy.”Lee, a committed Christian, died in July aged 97.U.S. Undersecretary for Economic Affairs Keith Krach and former Japanese prime minister Yoshiro Mori also attended his memorial.Lee’s remains will be interred at a military cemetery next month.

Arjun Tendulkar, son of legendary India batsman Sachin Tendulkar, has sparked rumours that he might be on the verge of joining the Mumbai Indians franchise for the 13th edition of Indian Premier League which will kick off from September 19th in the UAE. The youngster has been seen at the Wankhede Stadium cheering for MI since his childhood days, when his father, Sachin, was leading the franchise.Now, Arjun has grown up to be a highly-skilled left-arm pacer who has also impressed everyone with his batting skills in domestic and U-19 circuit. Recently, an image surfaced on the social media in which Arjun was seen enjoying in the swimming pool alongside MI players Trent Boult, Rahul Chahar and James Pattinson in the UAE.IPL 2020 Full CoverageThe image led to fans speculating on social media if Arjun has joined the four-time IPL-winning franchise. But as of now, the speculations are not true.Arjun has travelled with the MI franchise as part of the net bowlers contingent. This is not the first time that Arjun has travelled with the MI team, but the franchise has not signed him yet. The seamer will be bowling to MI batsmen in the nets in the UAE.IPL 2020 is scheduled to begin from September 19th in the UAE in which Mumbai Indians will take on Chennai Super Kings in the opening contest.
A recent policy brief issued by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace asserted that even in a pandemic world, India’s influence would enable it to become a strong counterweight to China. A cursory search of recent newspapers, policy statements, and even academic journals reveals this widespread belief.One may be forgiven for thinking that this idea dates to contemporary watershed moments of military or economic strength —such as India’s economic reforms of the early 1990s or the nuclear tests of 1998 — but this would be wrong. Shortly after India turned independent in 1947, and the Chinese Communist Party came to power in 1949, The New York Times declared that independent India would become “a great counterweight to China”. Given that in the eyes of the world, India has apparently been in the process of becoming a counterweight to China for 70 years, it’s important to examine what this means. In other words, if India were a counterweight to China, what would that entail? And whom would it benefit?The concept of one country being a counterweight to another, or “counterbalancing” as it is sometimes known, comes from realist and neo-realist theories in international relations. If there is one dominant power either in the world-at-large or within a region, the best chance of reducing the likelihood of war is for one country (or a group of countries) to counter it by acting as a balance. A counterbalancing country would take deliberate and assertive steps to match the dominant power in not simply size and population but in military spending and prowess, economic power, global influence, participation in international institutions, the strength of its alliances, and its reputation. This would make it risky for the dominant power to go to outright war with the counter-balancer. The father of neo-realism, Kenneth Waltz, famously declared that the most stable world was one that was bipolar, much like the Cold War world with the United States (US) and the Soviet Union counterbalancing each other.Which brings us to the current post-Cold War world where the rise of China is a source of huge worry for the dominant power, the US. While the US’ capabilities and influence still outstrip China’s — simply put, it is a superpower and China is not (yet) — it is important for it to find allies with a common cause to counter China’s rise. Thus, when it comes to counterbalancing, particularly in Asia, the US thinks of India. This is partly because China and India are heavyweights in the region. It is also because India is a democracy, and the US, therefore, sees India as a country akin to it.What it expects is for India to undertake a number of significant actions that will cement its role as a counterbalancer. Expanding the Indo-US defence partnership is, of course, one — the US has, for example, agreed to transfer sensitive military technology to India, engage in industry collaboration including 5G networks, and hold high-level defence talks, and joint exercises. But it expects not simply a strategic partnership but one that is implicitly and, perhaps even explicitly, anti-China. The US thus wants India to undertake an expanded role in the Indo-Pacific as a member of the Quad (along with Japan and Australia). It would like India to strengthen its economic and naval profile in Southeast Asia; strengthen its relationship with Japan; develop its own security and economic capabilities and commit to regional partners; and counter China’s naval expansion in the Indo-Pacific, including by lending its voice to the negotiating of a code of conduct for China in the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean.All of this then begs the question of whether India wants to act as a counterweight to China. Here, the evidence gets murky. There is a reason that the idea of India becoming a counterweight to China has been floating around for 70 years with little end in sight —while the word “non-alignment” has essentially faded from the Indian government’s vocabulary, the word “alliance” has not replaced it. A counter-balancer needs formal alliances, not simply partnerships — since, by its very definition, counter-balancing involves both serious assertiveness in foreign policy, and, therefore, strong support from a coterie of other countries.But as external affairs minister, S Jaishankar, pointed out just a few days ago, at a forum with US Vice President Mike Pence, China and India as rising powers needed to reach some kind of “understanding or equilibrium.” His statement hints at the reluctance that has always existed in the Indian government to become the US’ geopolitical tool.So if not explicit counterbalancing, what then? What are India’s possible options in the geopolitical triangle? India could continue to develop its partnership with the US, and hope that a commitment to any alliances or assurances of explicit security cooperation would not be needed.It could move under a US security umbrella à la Japan and South Korea. It could move away from the US, and commit to non-alignment between any future American and Chinese poles. Or it could, in the least plausible scenario given the current climate, decide to take concrete steps that would lead to long-term rapprochement with China.All of these actions come with costs and benefits. But, all else being equal, at some point India will have to make a difficult choice.Manjari Chatterjee Miller is associate professor of International Relations, Frederick S Pardee School of Global Studies, Boston University, and a research associate at the Oxford School of Global and Area Studies, University of OxfordThe views expressed are personal
Sims and his partners managed to completely thrash the record by spending a little over half an hour charging the vehicle while driving across the country. They trio stopped for just one hour 31 minutes and 32 seconds to replenish the Tesla Model 3 during the record-breaking run. They used a 150kW Tesla Supercharger station and three 350kW Ionity chargers during the 855-mile journey.Made it at 22:16.15h 46m overall.1h 31m 32s of charging.Old record well and truly smashed! pic.twitter.com/Z7GLrif1nz — Zero Carbon World (@ZeroCarbonWorld) September 12, 2020Zero Carbon trustee Dean Fielding said, “Electric vehicles, charging capabilities and the charging infrastructure have come on in leaps and bounds over the past decade, and we want to bring attention to the fact that the UK is increasingly becoming EV-friendly and that making the switch to an EV is feasible, practical and enjoyable for both long and short journeys."Zero Carbon World has funded more than 700 EV charging points across the UK. The charity aims to reduce UK’s CO2 emissions, challenging misconceptions surrounding CO2 reduction, and encouraging sustainability.Range and charging time are two of the biggest deal-breakers for people who want to buy electric vehicles around the world. Constantly improving technology, bigger and more powerful batteries and fast charging stations are increasingly reducing the anxieties among prospective buyers.Yet, time taken to fully charge an electric vehicle through regular charging station still takes hours. However, things seem to have certainly improved in UK, where the government has upgraded the EV charging infrastructure.
The Odisha government has made elaborate arrangements to facilitate free transportation and accommodation for candidates appearing for the NEET examination on Sunday in 83 centres across seven cities in the state, an official said.A total of 37,459 candidates will appear for the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test in Odisha.“The state government has made arrangements for free transportation and lodging facilities for candidates and their guardians,” NEET state nodal officer Polly Patnaik said.State-run buses will be available to facilitate free movement of candidates and their guardians from different districts to the examination centres, she said.The examinations will be conducted from 11 am to 5 pm in strict adherence to health safety protocols to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease.Patnaik said candidates will have to undergo thermal screening before entering the centres in Bhubaneswar, Cuttack, Angul, Berhampur, Rourkela, Balasore and Sambalpur.The East Coast Railway will also run special trains for NEET aspirants, an official said.“The trains will run from Khariar Road to Sambalpur via Titlagarh, Rayagada to Sambalpur, Bhadrak to Bhubaneswar via Cuttack and Keonjhar to Bhubaneswar via Cuttack,” he said.The Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) has arranged accommodation for NEET candidates and their parents at five engineering colleges here.Medical teams will be deployed at the colleges where students and their guardians will stay before the examination, BMC Commissioner P C Chaudhury said.
A rebound in garment orders after demand crashed during spring shutdowns is helping to revive the Bangladesh economy.Apparel makers, the country’s main export industry, say they are looking ahead to Christmas orders from the U.S. and other major markets.Remittances from Bangladeshi workers employed overseas have also recovered, helping to relieve pressures from a pandemic quasi-shutdown during the spring.The Asian Development Bank reported this week that the economic comeback was encouraging. It is forecasting the economy will grow at a robust 6.8% annual pace in the fiscal year that ends in June if current conditions persist.That’s a much brighter outlook than in April-May, when global clothing brands suspended or cancelled orders worth more than $3 billion, affecting about 4 million workers and thousands of factories.“At the moment we can say that the ready-made garment industry has been able to regain its growth trajectory upward compared to March-May,” Rubana Huq, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, or BGMEA, told The Associated Press.“As economies in the West were turning around we were successfully able to get the buyers back to the negotiating table, which is why 80% to 90% of the $3.18 billion in cancelled orders have been reinstated,” she said.Bangladesh earns about $35 billion annually from garment exports, mainly to the United States and Europe. The industry is the world’s second largest after China’s.Bangladesh’s exports rose 0.6% to $3.9 billion in July, after plummeting 83% to $520 million in April. Imports, which are reported on a quarterly basis, began recovering earlier, rising 36% in May-June.In August, exports rose 4.3% from a year earlier, to $2.96 billion, mostly driven by apparel shipments, according to the government’s Export Promotion Bureau. Garment shipments totaled $5.7 billion in July and August.“The garment sector is making a good comeback. Our agriculture is doing well. Remittances are coming. These all are good signs for the economy,” said Ahsan H. Mansur, executive director of the Policy Research Institute, a think tank in Dhaka.“The pace of the recovery is clearly visible. But challenges have been there too. The pace of the recovery will depend on how the pandemic behaves in the West over the next few months,” Mansur said.That’s the inestimable question facing everyone.As of Thursday, Bangladesh had reported more than 342,000 confirmed coronavirus infections and 4,823 deaths. The country confirmed its first positive case on March 8.Some experts say the actual number of infections is higher than the official count. The garment industry says few workers in its factories have fallen ill thanks to precautions such as employing fewer people on the production lines and imposing safety guidelines. The government imposed a nationwide lockdown on March 26, and the garments sector was closed for nearly three months, reopening only gradually.The country director for the ADB, Manmohan Parkash, said the government has managed the crisis well, “with appropriate economic stimulus and social protection measures.”“We are encouraged by the increase in exports and remittances, and hope the recovery will be sustained, which will help in achieving the projected growth rate,” Parkash said.
Maharashtra’s ruling Shiv Sena has asked the Centre to take a loan from the World Bank to help states while blaming it for the country’s “collapsed” economy, mishandling the Covid-19 lockdown and causing “chaos and uncertainty”. In an editorial in its mouthpiece Saamana, the Shiv Sena said the Centre must give financial aid to states to help them tide over the economic crisis as states fill up the coffers of the central government.“The Centre is responsible for the collapse of the economy. Fatal experiments like demonetisation [withdrawal of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 banknotes in 2016] are responsible for the chaos in the economy. Without any preparation [a countrywide] lockdown was announced, and while doing so there was no coordination...,” the editorial said.It added Union health minister Harsh Vardhan said on March 13 there is no medical emergency in the country. “On March 22, Prime Minister called for [voluntary] Janata curfew [for social distancing]. On March 24, after a notice of only four hours, a 21-day strict lockdown was announced. The chaos and uncertainty that started then is still going on. Never has there been so much chaos.”The editorial said states like Punjab, Delhi and West Bengal have sought financial assistance from the Centre. It added revenues of states such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar have reduced by 75%. The editorial asked the Centre to take a “hefty loan” from the World Bank and distribute money to the states while calling it the “only alternative”. It noted the Centre announced a relief package of Rs 20 lakh crore during the lockdown and added “it is a mystery where the money has gone”.The editorial said at least 22% of the Centre’s revenue comes from Mumbai, but it is not ready to help states. “Maharashtra, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Delhi have borne the maximum brunt of Covid-19 and suffered losses worth Rs 14.4 lakh crore,” the editorial said.The Centre late last month offered the states two borrowing options to plug a shortfall in their Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue, estimated at Rs 2.35 lakh crore in the current financial year, as the Covid-19 pandemic has taken a toll on the economy. The states can borrow Rs 97,000 crore at a reasonable interest rate and repay the amount from the cess charged on luxury and sin goods like liquor after the GST regime completes five years of implementation in June 2022. The second option is for the states to borrow the entire Rs 2.35 lakh crore in consultation with the central bank. Some states have insisted that the Centre borrow the money instead and compensate the states for the shortfall.
A 21-year-old woman was arrested in Bhopal on Friday for allegedly killing her one-month-old daughter since she wanted a male child, according to the police.The woman, Sarita Mewada, a resident of Dehriya Khajoori village of the district was arrested under Section 302 (murder) of IPC after the police found inconsistencies in her statements. She confessed to the crime later, the police said.Deputy inspector general (DIG) of police, Bhopal, Irshad Wali said, “The father of the baby, Sachin Mewada, lodged a complaint with the Khajoori police station on Thursday about his daughter reported missing from inside his house. A police team recovered the body of the baby from inside a 500 litre water tank kept inside a room of the complainant’s house with the lid shut from the top.”“During the investigation police got to know that the child and her mother Sarita were alone in the house when the child was reported missing by the mother,” he added.Police interrogated Sarita Mewada and she confessed to having committed the crime.The DIG said, “In her statement given to the police, Sarita said she married Sachin Mewada a year ago. In August, she gave birth to a girl child but she was not happy as she wanted a boy. Sarita said her in-laws were also unhappy over the birth of the girl child. On Thursday, the baby was crying when she got upset and dropped her in the water tank. Then, she closed the lid of the tank.”The woman was produced before the district court from where she was sent to jail under judicial remand.
“I don’t enjoy the society we have become. The vilification and the way a person is portrayed in the media is sad,” says actor Saqib Saleem talking about the investigation of Sushant Singh Rajput’s death.“I have lost faith in news channels as everyone has their own version about the case. They show point of view. The job of news channels is to report facts not to give a narrative to the audiences. I am upset. It is unfortunate that a young promising actor like Sushant is no more. No one knows what happened and the CBI, NCB, ED are investigating his death. We all want justice for Sushant and Rhea (Chakraborty, actor and Sushant’s girl friend),” he says. Saleem wants a fair investigation but is also quite disappointed at how things have played out. “It is heart-breaking as Rhea is a friend of mine and as a friend, it is my responsibility to stand by her and her family at this time. Having said that, the case is in court and I hope and pray that the Indian judiciary gives a fair result of what happened. We all want to know what has happened,” he emphasises.The Rangbaaz actor is also taken aback by the “hatred on social media”. He is sad that while social media was created to connect people, now it’s about people writing “rubbish” and getting away with it. “Actors become soft targets. We can’t fight everyone online. The industry’s image is being tarnished but the industry is not just the actors but technicians, directors, creative talent and Bollywood generates a lot of revenue through films. Rather than talking about generalising the whole industry, people point out individuals who have done anything wrong. Moreover, most of the stuff being said is propaganda. Truth will come out soon,” he says.He adds that the hatred was the reason he left Twitter two months ago. “It was getting too much for no reason. I didn’t want to wake up to negativity every day. If I put up a post, which someone doesn’t like, not only do I get abused but my sister and mother do too. How is that fair? Tomorrow, when I have children I wouldn’t want them to be abused because their father is an actor,” he says.The actor will be seen in a web show Crackdown soon. After doing an action oriented show, Rangbaaz, he is excited about donning another action role in this thriller. “I started acting in 2011 and last year, people would say I look like a bachcha. They would suggest I do the boy-next-door roles but I wanted to do intense and action-based roles. When I did Rangbaaz, I enjoyed the intensity of the story and characters. It was a great experience. Now, the experience of working on Crackdown with my friend-director Apoorva Lakhia has been mind-blowing. He has created a world of espionage with RAW officers, how the secret service works without getting credit. There are an interesting bunch of actors and it was an interesting role so I couldn’t say no,” he says.
Updated: Sep 16, 2020 14:46 ISTChina reported some positive results on the phase 3 trial of a Covid-19 vaccine, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin has said. The UAE, which is part of the phase 3 trial of this Chinese vaccine, has reported positive results too.Several vaccine trials are underway at present. Here is all you need to know about this particular vaccine1. This vaccine is being developed by China National Phramaceutical Group (Sinopharm). It is a drug with an inactivated vaccine.2. China has four Covid-19 vaccines at the final stage.3. Sinopharm and Sinovac Biotech (US listed) are developing three vaccines. The fourth one is being developed by CanSino Biologic. It was approved for use among Chinese military.4. The UAE has already conducted trials of this China-developed vaccine. The third phase started in July.5. Early this week, the UAE granted emergency approval for the use of this vaccine. It will be administered to frontline workers.6. The UAE authorities said 31,000 volunteers, representing 125 nationalities have been administered the vaccine during the trial. Apart from mild side-effects, no severe illness has been reported so far.
Updated: Sep 19, 2020 22:10 ISTThis time, Leeds was on the right end of a 4-3 thriller in the Premier League. A week after losing at champion Liverpool by the same score line on the opening day of the season, Leeds was involved in another wild contest in its first home game back in the division and came out on top against fellow promoted team Fulham.Helder Costa scored in each half for Leeds, the second goal proving to be the winner at an empty Elland Road for Marcelo Bielsa’s attack-minded side.Fulham, which had two goals from striker Aleksandar Mitrovic, has now lost back-to-back games to open the season, having already been beaten 3-0 by Arsenal.Between them, Leeds and Fulham have conceded 14 goals in four games so far. West Bromwich Albion, the other side promoted from the second-tier Championship for this season, has conceded eight.Costa gave Leeds a fifth-minute lead by slamming a shot in off the bar from an acute angle after Fulham midfielder Harrison Reed inadvertently flicked on a corner by the hosts.Penalties have been a feature of the first two rounds of the league and there were two in six minutes here.In the 35th, Mitrovic converted a spot kick after Robin Koch tripped Joe Bryan, despite trying to pull out of his attempted tackle. Koch also gave away a penalty at Anfield last weekend.Mateusz Klich replied with one of his own for Leeds in the 41st after Bryan pushed Patrick Bamford in the back.Bamford then scored for the second straight match by stroking home a finish following a pass from Klich, before providing the cross that Costa swept in in the 57th for 4-1.Fulham fought back through goals by Bobby Reid in the 62nd — four minutes after coming on as a substitute — and Mitrovic in the 67th but Leeds held on.
Actor Vidya Balan, who was recently seen as mathematics wizard Shakuntala Devi in the eponymous biopic, is likely to play a key role in Mahesh Babu’s upcoming Telugu film Sarkaru Vaari Paata. As per a News Minute report, Vidya has been approached with the role of Mahesh’s sister in the movie.With the project due to go on the floors in the US post Dussehra, the makers are busy finalising the rest of the cast and crew. So far, it has been confirmed that Keerthy Suresh plays the leading lady. Recently, it was rumoured that Anil Kapoor has been approached with the offer to play the antagonist.It’s worth mentioning that the makers had initially held talks with Kannada actor Kichcha Sudeep for the same role. However, he couldn’t set aside dates due to his current acting assignments.Apparently, a month-long schedule is planned in Washington DC and the makers have already begun the visa formalities. The team will travel post Dussehra, provided the current situation doesn’t get worse. Keerthy Suresh has been roped in as the leading lady. She will be sharing the screen space with Mahesh for the first time.Mahesh’s last on screen appearance was in Sarileru Neekevvaru, which was a box-office blockbuster. The film, directed by Anil Ravipudi, raked in over Rs 200 crore at the box-office. In the film, Mahesh Babu played a soldier who comes to a small town and saves a family from the clutches of a rowdy politician.Mahesh returned to a set since the lockdown last week to shoot for an advertisement in Hyderabad.

Hardik Pandya has been away from cricket for a while but the Mumbai Indians all-rounder feels it is just a matter of spending some time in the middle before he starts putting the kind of performances he is known for. Hardik, along with brother Krunal, has been a part of the core that Mumbai Indians has managed to keep together for several years now.“The way I’m hitting the ball right now, the shape I’m in, the mental space I’m in, it is just a matter of time that I go and spend some time on the ground and I think things will come out pretty well,” Pandya said in a video posted by Mumbai Indians’ official Twitter handle.ALSO READ: Five penalty runs will stop teams from Mankading, says Muttiah Muralitharan“No matter how far I go from the game, no matter how long I stay out, when I come back, it has to be worth it. I have prepared very well and I think, great things are coming ahead,” the 26-year-old flamboyant all-rounder added.Pandya, who underwent a back surgery in London last year, made a comeback in March and was even selected for the home ODI series against South Africa, which was abandoned due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Pandya has been a key member of the team and his form with bat and ball will be crucial if Mumbai Indians are to challenge for a record extending fifth title.ALSO READ: ‘Raina’s absence is a major concern’: Dean Jones explains why CSK face a huge challenge“IPL is something that I have enjoyed a lot and I would like to make a comeback very strong and I’m just looking forward to it,” said Pandya.He further spoke about the inevitability of injuries in a sportsperson’s life and how he has worked on his fitness.“In my life I have realised one thing that injuries would be with me. No one wants to get injured, but I accept the fact that what I do, injuries would be a part of it.“Injuries have always kept me going, always kept me motivated. Actually taught me how much I have to put in the hard yards and the hard work has always increased, never decreased,” said the Baroda all-rounder.“Luckily, me and (my brother) Krunal (Pandya) had the privilege to have a gym in our house. So because of that portion, we were able to work on our fitness...,” he said.“And I always feel that if you go one step ahead in your fitness, there are much more magical moments in your life (that) are waiting,” the right-hander emphasised.
Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy plans to digitalise 45,000 schools by the next academic year, said Audimulapu Suresh, State Education Minister.“Officials are working day and night to meet the CM’s deadline of completing work on the Nadu-Nedu initiative by the beginning of the academic year in June,” said Suresh.It will be the first time in the history of Andhra Pradesh that government schools will give tough competition to the private schools and institutions in terms of digitalisation.This plan will be implemented in a phased manner. In the first phase government has its aim to install 10,000 smart TVs, the cost of which comes up to a total of 45 crores to 50 crores.Every government school in the state will be having its own smart television for the digitalised learning, so the days are gone wherein for good education parents use to think of sending their children to private schools at a higher cost.Earlier in the first week of September in a review meeting held at the camp office in Tadepalli by CM Reddy, it was directed to the officials that no student should be left out of digital education and all government schools should be equipped with the centralised integrated system smart TVs.

The England and Wales Cricket Board’s successful completion of their summer schedule inside bio-secure ‘bubbles’ is a blueprint for other countries to stage matches amid the Covid-19 pandemic, one-day international (ODI) skipper Eoin Morgan said.England returned to action following the Covid-19 stoppage in July with three tests against the West Indies in bio-secure venues at Southampton and Manchester before matches across all three formats against Ireland, Pakistan and Australia.“From where we were five months ago to have had a full set of international fixtures and to have cricket back on the TV is huge for the game,” Morgan told reporters.“I think we’ve pioneered and mapped out exactly how to get cricket back on. Given we’ve had no positive cases within the bubble I think it’s a very good example and one every team around the world will look at.“Whether they can model it exactly like that might be a bit more challenging but I think the ECB has done an outstanding job.”Morgan told the BBC that the health and wellbeing of everyone involved had been at the forefront of their thinking before a ball was bowled.“If there was another summer of a bio-secure bubble we would probably have to look at guys spending more time outside of it or families being allowed to come in,” he added.
Sonet has already made headlines in the past for the kind of features it promises to offer but in order to really set the segment on fire and make a name for itself, the pricing will have to be set right.(Also Read: 2020 Kia Sonet first drive review: Is it worth the hype?)Based on the inputs from several Kia dealerships, it will be safe to expect that Sonet may start from around ₹7 lakh in India. But in order to really make a mark, Kia may go for an even more aggressive entry price tag starting from around ₹6.70 lakh to ₹6.80 lakh. This price may, of course, rise in the future as Kia had used a similar strategy in case of Seltos. The SUV had received a minor hike as soon as the introductory offer ended within months of launch.The expected entry level pricing of ₹7 lakh will help Sonet undercut its rivals such as Maruti Vitara Brezza, Mahindra XUV300 and Tata Nexon, all of which start at a slightly higher price tag of ₹7.34 lakh, ₹7.95 lakh and ₹6.99 lakh, respectively.In short, Kia will most likely place the Sonet on the same lines as the Hyundai Venue which is currently the segment leader and is priced at ₹6.70 lakh.(Also Read: Kia Sonet to be available in seven colour options and three dual-tone hues)The Sonet will be made available in dual trim just like the Seltos. There will be a Tech Line trim as well as the higher-spec GT Line trim. Prices for the top-of-the-line variants may extend somewhere up to ₹13 lakh.(All prices are ex-showroom, Delhi)
Even though Scientific American had never endorsed a US presidential candidate in the magazine’s 175-year history, its top editor has said there was little internal debate over a decision to back Democrat Joe Biden.Editor-in-Chief Laura Helmuth said President Donald Trump’s administration was much worse for the scientific community than the magazine had feared. The magazine’s endorsement was posted online on Tuesday, a day after Trump questioned the science of climate change in relation to the California wildfires. Helmuth said the timing was coincidental and the editorial was written during the past two months.Scientific American said that “the evidence and the science show that Donald Trump has basically damaged the United States and its people because he rejects evidence and science”.The editorial by senior editor Josh Fischman sharply condemned Trump for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic.The magazine criticised Trump for seeking cutbacks in scientific funding and hobbling the US response to climate change. Biden, the magazine said, “has a record of following the data and being guided by science”. There was no immediate reply to a request for comment from the Trump campaign. There’s been some pushback. Conservative columnist SE Cupp tweeted, “I do have mixed feelings on whether this is a good use of scientific clout.”

A stringent scanning of imported goods will start from September 21 to curb rampant violations of “rules of origin” that have opened floodgates for dumping of Chinese goods in India through third countries such as Vietnam, Singapore and Indonesia with which New Delhi has free trade agreements (FTAs), two officials said requesting anonymity.“The Customs are armed with the new mechanism of verification that kicks in from September 21. It gives them full authority to check all FTA imports such as mobile phones, white goods, set-top boxes, incense sticks, cameras and other electronic gazettes more closely,” said one of the officials, who works for the Union finance ministry.The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) on August 21 had notified -- the Customs (Administration of Rules of Origin under Trade Agreements) Rules, 2020, or CAROTAR, 2020 requiring detail disclosures by importers to claim concessional duty benefits under trade pacts such as FTAs. “The CAROTAR, 2020 shall come into force on September 21, 2020,” the CBIC order had said.Interpreting the Customs’ notification, consultancy firm EY India said according to the new rule, importers need to furnish details of certificate of origin (CoO) in the bill of entry and make necessary declaration in a bid to claim preferential rate of duty. “The importer shall possess information to demonstrate the manner in which the origin criteria are satisfied and maintain all supporting documents for at least five years from the date of filing of the bill of entry,” it said.The officials mentioned above said the Customs could also ask for supporting documents and information and when in doubt, deny the benefit of the FTA duty concession or allow it provisionally pending verification.“The industry has repeatedly represented to the government to review the existing FTAs and take action to put a brake on their misuse,” the first official said, quoting finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s budget announcement this year.She had said that undue claims of FTA benefits had posed a threat to the domestic industry and such imports require stringent checks.Union minister for commerce and industry Piyush Goyal had also cautioned the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) to strengthen the “rules of origin” provisions to check the influx of Chinese goods in the Indian market.Co-chairing the 17th Asean-India Economic Ministers Consultations, which was held on August 29, through video conference, Goyal had highlighted that the FTA has to be “mutually beneficial” and expressed the need to strengthen the rules of origin provisions, work towards removal of non-tariff barriers and provide better market access.“In case of Asean countries, the merchandise trade gap has risen from $5 billion in 2010, when FTA was implemented, to more than $22 billion now,” a second official said.“Our position of merchandise trade surplus with Vietnam and Singapore has reversed in the last three to four years. From a position of a surplus of $2 billion with Vietnam at the start of FTA in 2010, now India has a trade deficit of about $3 billion with it. While our trade deficit with Singapore stands at over $4 billion,” he said.“The trade gap has also widened with Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia. The painful part of this story has been that these FTAs have been misused widely to export goods to India in utter disregard to the ‘rules of origin’ requirement,” he added.Vietnam has been exporting a large number of electronic items. Of late, electronics imports have started coming in from Indonesia as well. Thailand and Malaysia have also been exporting increased quantities of electronic and other goods to India, he said.“Investigations have revealed that items such as TVs, mobile phones, set-top boxes, telecom network products, metals coming from FTA countries did not meet the prescribed rule of origin criterion,” he added.In some cases, the Customs has detected that a few importers were smuggling restricted goods such as incense sticks in the guise of goods declared to be imported under an FTA, he said.In the last five years, the Customs have detected fraudulent claims under FTA to the tune of Rs 1,200 crore, he added.
Former Shiromani Akali Dal MLA Manjinder Singh Sirsa, perhaps encouraged with the current conversation around Bollywood’s alleged drug abuse problem, has once again raked up Karan Johar’s house party video. Sirsa has filed a complaint with the Narcotics Control Bureau, asking the agency to investigate what he has alleged was a ‘drug party’ video from last year.Sharing his letter to NCB chief Rakesh Asthana, Sirsa said that he met with him and asked him to launch an investigation into the video. “I met Sh. Rakesh Asthana, Chief of @narcoticsbureauat BSF head quarter, Delhi regarding submission of complaint for investigation & action against film Producer @karanjohar & others for organizing drug party at his residence in Mumbai That party video must be investigated into!” he wrote.The attached screenshots of the letter show that he wants actors Deepika Padukone, Vicky Kaushal, Malaika Arora,Varun Dhawan, Arjun Kapoor, and Shahid Kapoor to all be investigated for consumption, possession, and allowing premises to be used for commission of offenses’. Sirsa said in his letter that the actors were seen ‘consuming drugs’ at the party. The video, however, doesn’t show any participant consuming drugs.I met Sh.

Apparently, you are not allowed to put your phone in your back pocket. Apparently, a shadow of light is perceived to be some kind of powder.”“My mother, 5 minutes before this video, was sitting with us. It was that kind of a family, happy, social gathering, where friends were sitting and having a good time and we were listening to some music, having some good food and having good conversational energy there. There was nothing else going on,” he had said.The NCB has so far arrest almost 20 persons in connection with the Sushant Singh Rajput death case. It had launched an investigation after it received official communication from Enforcement Directorate (ED), in which there were various chats related to drug consumption, procurement, usage and transportation in connection with the actor’s death case.
National Conference president Farooq Abdullah on Saturday addressed Army’s Shopian encounter where three men were killed in July this year during his speech at the ongoing Monsoon Session of Parliament.Requesting government to compensate the victims, the former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir said, “I am happy that the Army has admitted that three Shopian men were killed mistakenly. I hope the government gives a hefty compensation,” as quoted by PTI.This was Farooq Abdullah’s first address in the Parliament since the special status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 was abrogated on August 5, 2019. The local leaders were put into detention after the special status in Jammu and Kashmir was lifted.“We are not against any operation carried out by security forces in Jammu and Kashmir, but we are against the killing of innocent lives during the operations,” Farooq Abdullahhad told news agency ANI on Amshipora case before his Parliament address.We are not against any operation carried out by security forces in Jammu and Kashmir, but we are against the killing of innocent lives during the operations: Farooq Abdullah, National Conference MP and former J&K CM, on Amshipora case. pic.twitter.com/NHK77pd0L8 — ANI (@ANI) September 19, 2020During an investigations into the Amshipora case, the army found evidence that its men (Jammu and Kashmir) violated powers under the Armed Forces Special Powers Act during an encounter in Shopian district of Kashmir in which three Rajouri locals were killed.The families of the three men have demanded severe punishment for the guilty.Army chief general Manoj Mukund Naravane on Friday said that the investigation into the Amshipora case will be held with utmost fairness.“Amshipora case investigations will be conducted with utmost fairness and will be taken to their logical conclusion.

On August 22, this newspaper published an exclusive report based on a presentation made by the ministry of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). The presentation said that as on August 1, three-fourths of India’s MSMEs were working at less than half their potential capacity. It also said that more than 90% had opened up, showing that the unlock process, at least in principle, has been almost completed. These statistics underline the central economic challenge facing the economy. Just allowing enterprises to open is not going to restore the status quo ante, which existed before the pandemic forced a nationwide lockdown. To be sure, the economy was not in great shape even before the pandemic. GDP growth rate fell from 8.3% in 2016-17 to 7%, 6.1% and 4.2% in 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20. Most estimates expect India’s GDP to contract by 5% or more this year.MSMEs account for 30% of GDP. They employ almost one-fourth of India’s workers. That an overwhelming share of MSMEs is not using even their existing capacity means that they are facing a crisis of demand. If this situation is allowed to persist, it will generate a vicious cycle. Firms will lay off workers. Laid-off workers will lose their salaries, which will further squeeze demand. Orders for new investments and raw materials will be postponed, or worse, cancelled. This will lead to yet another round of job losses and demand depression. These developments will have an adverse impact on the financial sector as well. As revenues start falling short of past expectations, loan defaults will increase, which will add to the existing mountain of bad debt. All these developments have implications for India’s economic recovery, both in the short-and-medium term.Breaking this vicious cycle requires urgent policy intervention. The government was wise to focus on liquidity challenges in its initial response to Covid-19. But it needs to shift gears. Demand, not liquidity, is the main challenge facing the economy today. At a time when consumer and business sentiment is down, the only way to boost demand is a fiscal stimulus. While there is some merit in the argument that it should be timed appropriately, at least the road map should be laid out as soon as possible. Any further delay on this front will only make matters worse.

It’s the last ball of the 2019 final. Chennai Super Kings need two to defend their title while Mumbai Indians are in search of a dot ball. Lasith Malinga bowls a perfect slower one which Shardul Thakur fails to connect and is trapped leg before. The Rohit Sharma-led MI become champions for a record fourth time.That final on May 12 in Hyderabad is among the many potboilers that CSK and MI have dished out over the years in the Indian Premier League (IPL). As the 2020 edition finally gets going in Abu Dhabi on Saturday, five months after it was originally scheduled due to Covid-19 restrictions, it will be the two most successful teams in the tournament’s history with seven titles between them which will once again lock horns.Neither will there be any fans to build up the atmosphere nor is the tournament being played in India, but it shouldn’t be a deterrent for an exciting start.READ| What does it take to succeed in the IPL?Of late, MI have been CSK’s Achilles heel. It was no more evident than the 2019 season which saw CSK losing all four matches including the play-offs and the final. MI are the only team against which they have lost more matches than they have won.This time around, MI will be without Malinga but their core is intact and as coach Mahela Jayawardene puts it they are “ready for action”. MI will again bank on Rohit Sharma, Jasprit Bumrah, Hardik and Krunal Pandya, Kieron Pollard to take them over the line but they have added firepower too.Chris Lynn has been brought in to add some strength to the top-order, if MI think-tank decides to push Rohit Sharma down the order to add stability to the middle-order. The bowling line-up has been spruced up with the addition of New Zealand’s left-arm quickie Trent Boult, Australia Nathan Counter-Nile, who is a good hitter too, Dhawal Kulkarni and James Pattinson (replacement for Malinga).While MI have been on top of their preparations ever since they landed in UAE, same can’t be said about CSK. Their most experienced player and middle-order mainstay Suresh Raina and veteran spinner Harbhajan Singh pulled out of the tournament, citing personal reasons.Their preparations took a setback with frontline seamer Deepak Chahar and promising batsman Ruturaj Gaikwad testing positive. Now the question is whether the ‘Dad’s Army’--as they are referred to because of abundance of 30-plus players in their squad—will be a bit under prepared?The pulling out of Raina, the second highest run scorer in IPL’s history, will be a big blow to their middle-order. With CSK not opting to bring in replacements, right now their only options to fill in for Raina at No 3 are either Rayudu or Jadhav. The other option is Jadhav’s Maharashtra teammate Gaikwad, who is yet to get green signal to resume practice.
The past few months have not really been the best of period for many in the country, especially those in the entertainment industry. First it was the pandemic that kind of bring life to a standstill and then the negativity on social media and subsequent backlash that the film industry has been facing. Actor Taapsee Pannu feels that things have taken a turn for the worse in the recent times, something that even she did not see coming.Talking about the time when the Covid-19 crisis was jus setting in, she says “I genuinely thought we will come out of it as kinder human beings as people who will value our privileges more and people will value each other more because we are part of a human race and one virus has left us shaken upside down. But looking at things have been happening lately, I totally felt opposite of what I thought of what will happen.”The 33-year-old shares how people have lost their way and a lot of anger has seeped in.“We’ve become more frustrated, we’re ready to jump to judgmental conclusions about anyone and everyone , we’ve lost the sensitivity and heart towards people and situations. We have some kind of pent up anger in us for whatever reasons which we are trying to vent out in our lives on anyone and any issue without being mindful of what repercussions it may have,” she explains.On what Pannu thinks may have been responsible for this change in human behaviour, she says, “May be because of the joblessness that we all have had for the last few months and that’s the irritation and frustration and that has what has made us do angry about everything around but something has definitely gone wrong.”However, calling herself a “hopeless optimist”, she still believes that when lives will get back to normal “we will realise what the hell we were doing all this while and probably gain better consciousness and get back to a better life.”Amid all this chaos, the actor has found solace in verses as she has recited two powerful poems about the condition of migrant crisis, and to mark International Democracy Day (September 15), she recited Samwaad, which talks about the plight of democracy in the country.“Whenever people try to question what is happening in the society or what is happening in the country , a certain section starts to tag them as anti-National where as the intention of those people is just to ask for a better condition. After every few years in our country right from Independence till now every few years there is a certain kind of challenge that our country has faced. This is regardless of who’s is in power,” she says.Pannu also says that history is proof that change is constant and the citizens have and will always retaliate in a certain way. “There always has been some kind of a turmoil every few years in our country where the citizens are pushed to the wall. And when they are pushed to the wall, eventually there came a break point where a revolt started and certain kind of change happened,” she concludes.
Australia batsman Steve Smith is recovering from his head injury but is no certainty to be recalled for the one-day series decider against England, coach Justin Langer said on Tuesday.Smith missed the first two matches after being hit on the head by a ball in the nets last week and is expected to have his fitness assessed during a training session later in the day.The decider is at Old Trafford on Wednesday.“He is definitely tracking in the right direction and we are hopeful he will be right for (Wednesday),” Langer told reporters in a video call.“He did all his running (on Monday), some high speed running, worked hard as part of the protocols. He has ticked every box at the moment.”England won the second ODI on Sunday by 24 runs to level the three-match series after the visitors, chasing a modest target of 232, suffered a dramatic collapse.Australia opener David Warner has struggled for form, scoring six, six and a duck in his last three innings of the white-ball tour, including the T20 series.He has been dismissed in all four matches he has played by Jofra Archer, who has now taken the lefthander’s wicket seven times in 10 internationals, including three in last year’s Ashes.“It’s been a great contest, hasn’t it?” said Langer.“Davey, he is a superstar. He is an incredibly important part of our side, so I am sure he is working over-time to certainly be up for (Wednesday) night’s game.”

The existing mechanism governing self-regulation of media is ineffective and needs to be strengthened so that media freedom is not used to the detriment of human dignity, the Supreme Court observed on Friday, taking exception to the contents of a television programme, Bindas Bol, aired by Sudarshan News.A three-judge bench headed by Justice DY Chandrachud said that the court will not stand in the way of media discussing dubious funding of NGOs or issues concerning national security, and it is fully conscious of the dangers of restricting media freedom after the excesses of the Emergency in 1975. But free speech rights and media freedom cannot be used to the detriment of human dignity, the court added.The court was responding to the defence put up by Sudarshan News, which claimed that it had through its programme only intended to highlight the alleged dubious sources of foreign funding received by an organisation, Zakat Foundation, which supports and provides coaching for civil service aspirants.“We know what happened during Emergency (when media was censored by the ruling dispensation). So we have to ensure there is free flow of information. But we have to also ensure human dignity is protected and human dignity should be balanced with free speech,” Justice Chandrachud remarked.Experts said that a verdict in the case, which has taken a larger dimension over the course of its hearings and sparked a debate on media freedom, could have larger implications on TV journalism at a time when news content has become a divisive issue.“It is a loud clarion call to the media to self-regulate and engage in responsible journalism. The court has exercised maximum restraint and has expressed disinclination against prior restraint. If the court passes directions, it could have a significant impact on TV media. In the prevailing conditions, such guidelines will be momentous for Indian media. Self-regulation has been found wanting,” said Supreme Court lawyer, MF Philip.The Supreme Court on Friday told Sudarshan News that targeting an entire community on the basis of dubious funding of one organisation is not acceptable, and calling for a more robust self-regulation mechanism. It directed the News Broadcasters Association (NBA) to come up with concrete suggestions on strengthening the body and its self-regulation mechanism.NBA, which is a private association of 26news and current affairs broadcasters, has framed a code of conduct for self-regulation of media. It can hold inquiry against broadcasters for violation of the code and can impose fine of up to Rs 1 lakh.The court, however, took a grim view of NBA’s functioning, calling it “toothless”.“NBA says they have a committee headed by a retired Supreme Court judge. They can impose a maximum fine of Rs 1 lakh. This shows how toothless you are,” justice Chandrachud said, underscoring that the fine will not have any impact on a news channel.He also pointed out that the NBA’s jurisdiction extends only to those broadcasters which are its members.Advocate Nisha Bhambani, representing NBA, said that it was not a toothless organisation, and several news channels have apologised and published retraction after NBA’s intervention.“Several Supreme Court and high court judgments have commended our regulations,” she said.“Do you watch TV? Are you able to control it?,” justice Chandrachud asked.Bhambani replied that the situation has improved significantly, but admitted that many news channels were not members of NBA which meant it could not exercise jurisdiction over such channels.Sudarshan News, which is not a member , in its programme Bindas Bol had made allegations regarding the entry of Muslim candidates in civil services. In the programme’s trailer, which was widely shared on social media platforms, the anchor and editor-in-chief of Sudarshan news, Suresh Chavhanke, was seen questioning how there has been a sudden increase in the number of Muslims succeeding in IAS and IPS exams.Chavhanke went on to ask about what the consequences would be if “Jihadis from Jamia [university]” would hold positions of authority and power like that of Collector and Secretary.A lawyer, advocate Firoz Iqbal Khan, approached the top court, which, on September 15, barred further telecast of the controversial programme after it expressed its disapproval of the first four episodes of the show.Senior counsel Shyam Divan, representing Sudarshan News, said that the programme raised serious concerns regarding terrorist organisations funding Zakat Foundation. He pointed to a recent media report about surveillance of Indian leaders by a Chinese company arguing that media has to bring out such stories in national interest.The bench which also comprised justices Indu Malhotra and KM Joseph, said that national security is of paramount importance but took exception to the manner in which the controversial programme depicted THE Muslim community, particularly by showing stereotyped representative images.The bench repeatedly referred to the visual which formed part of the programme which showed flames of fire along with a person in a green t-shirt and skull cap, and described some of the images as “hurtful”.The court asked Sudarshan News to file an affidavit giving details of what changes it proposed to make regarding the programme so as to convince the court to lift the injunction imposed on September 15.The case will be heard next on September 21.
Dia Mirza expressed support for Jaya Bachchan, who spoke in Parliament about the alleged defamation of the film industry by some of its members. In a tweet, Dia reminded that people of the film fraternity have always played their part in giving back to society and helped governments.“Jayaji is absolutely right. So grateful that she spoke up for our industry. We are always committed to contribute towards social upliftment and social good. The industry has always helped governments. This vilification of our film industry is unjust and condemnable,” she wrote.Jayaji is absolutely right. So grateful that she spoke up for our industry. We are always committed to contribute towards social upliftment and social good. The industry has always helped governments. This vilification of our film industry is unjust and condemnable. — Dia Mirza (@deespeak) September 15, 2020On Tuesday, Jaya, who is a Samajwadi Party MP, raised the issue of the portrayal of the film industry as a ‘gutter’. “People in the entertainment industry are being flogged by social media. People who made their names in the industry have called it a gutter. I completely disagree. I hope that the government tells such people not to use this kind of language,” she said, according to ANI.Though Jaya did not take any names, it appears that she was making a reference to Kangana Ranaut’s claims that Bollywood is a ‘gutter’ and 99% of people in the industry engage in the use of drugs.“Just because there are some people, you can’t tarnish the image of the entire industry. I am ashamed that yesterday one of our members in Lok Sabha, who is from the film industry, spoke against it. It is a shame,” she added, referring to comments about the film industry’s ‘drug addiction’ made by BJP MP Ravi Kishan on Monday.Several Bollywood celebrities came out in support of Jaya, after her explosive speech in the Rajya Sabha. Taapsee Pannu, Richa Chadha, Sonam Kapoor, Mallika Sherawat, Anubhav Sinha and others lauded her for speaking up for the film fraternity.However, Kangana hit back at Jaya, asking if she would have felt the same way if her own children, Abhishek Bachchan and Shweta Nanda, were targeted in the film industry. “Jaya ji would you say the same thing if in my place it was your daughter Shweta beaten, drugged and molested as a teenage, would you say the same thing if Abhieshek complained about bullying and harassment constantly and found hanging one day? Show compassion for us also,” she said.
Floods in north Bihar and the districts of Uttar Pradesh (UP), bordering Nepal, during the monsoon season, cause enormous losses in lives and property. Similarly, large parts of Nepal’s Tarai get submerged. This tragedy repeats on a loop every year. Heavy rains in the catchment areas of the major trans-boundary river systems — the Kosi, Gandak/Narayani and Karnali/Ghagra as well as Rapti and Mahakali/Sharda — lead to substantial run-offs as these rivers debouch into the plains, causing widespread flooding.So far, the two countries have adopted flood-control measures that largely comprise river-training works, including embankment construction. This approach comes with its problems. Due to soil erosion and landslides in the upper catchment area, particularly of the eastern rivers, the run-offs are heavily laden with silt. This results in a rise in the level of the river beds. In some places, the Kosi now flows above the surrounding territory. Embankments provide a temporary respite. In the long-run, if the banks are breached, as happened in 2008 to the east afflux bund, there are catastrophic consequences. The problem is further compounded by the fact that the Kosi has made significant oscillations in its course over the last 200 years.Both countries blame each other for the floods. The chief ministers of UP and Bihar complain to the prime minister that Nepal was not providing full cooperation on embankment construction for these trans-boundary rivers and their tributaries, even though some of this activity is financed by India.Nepal, on the other hand, blames India for the flooding of its Tarai plains. It argues that India has constructed roads all along the India-Nepal border without installing adequate drainage. The roads, it contends, act like an embankment and cause submergence of land and villages on Nepal’s side. A report of a joint India-Nepal technical team that did not find any evidence for this allegation has not been accepted by the Nepali authorities.A longer term more sustainable approach is needed to address the root causes of the problem. India must cooperate with Nepal on the prevention of soil erosion and reforestation projects including in the Chure (Shiwalik) Hills under the Rashtrapati Chure Conservation Programme, a project under the patronage of the president of Nepal.More importantly, we need to revive the many reservoir projects agreed upon in the past and whose implementation has been tardy. The Narendra Modi government provided a huge impetus to the Pancheshwar Hydro-Power Project on the Mahakali/Sharda River that had remained stalled for almost two decades since the mid-1990s. Unfortunately, six years down the road, it has got bogged down again, particularly over Nepal’s refusal to accept India’s proposal to include the waters of the Lower Sharda Barrage in the existing consumptive usage of the Mahakali waters.If this issue is not sorted out at the political level, the project will be delayed again at a huge cost. The last time the project was delayed, the overall cost increased from ~12,000 crore to ~40,000 crore even as the total capacity has been reduced from 6,720 MW to 5,040 MW largely due to hydrological factors.Another priority should be the revival of the Kosi high dam proposal. Though the Kosi Barrage was built several decades ago, and embankment works have proceeded apace, the high dam proposal has not made much progress since its conception in the 1950s. The joint project office has been unable to complete the survey-related work needed for the preparation of the detailed project report (DPR), even though it was set up in 2004, in part due to resistance from local communities. Considerable efforts are needed to address the concerns of the local population, especially in the area that will be submerged. The Nepali authorities are less than supportive on the grounds that the entire submergence will be in Nepal, while the bulk of the benefits in terms of irrigation and flood control will go to India. The Sun Kosi Storage-cum-Diversion Scheme has been made an integral part of the project keeping in mind Nepal’s interests. An objective and fair system for sharing the costs and benefits from the project will need to be worked out.So far, India has opted for a bilateral approach. But Bangladesh too is an interested party as the project will regulate water flows into the Ganga and the Padma. Trilateral cooperation will make it easier politically for Nepal to pursue the project. If the project is implemented, an important benefit for Nepal will be the creation of inland waterways along the Ganga and Kosi, which will result in a significant reduction of logistics costs for trade. It will also significantly strengthen sub-regional cooperation. Though relations with Nepal are currently fraught and it is unlikely that solutions will be easily found, India needs to review joint reservoir projects strategically at the political level.Ranjit Rae is former ambassador to NepalThe views expressed are personal
Updated: Sep 19, 2020 10:54 ISTSchools in Jharkhand would remain closed for students of classes nine to 12, as the secondary education wing of state education and literacy department has not yet sent its proposal for reopening of schools to the state disaster management department for approval.The education department was earlier planning to reopen the schools from September 21 for students of classes nine to 12, who want to consult teachers at school to clear educational doubts.Joint secretary of state disaster management department, Manish Tiwary, said, “We have not received any such proposal from the education department till date.”The Unlock 4.0 guidelines, issued on August 30 by the Union ministry of home affairs, said schools will continue to remain closed till September 30. At the same time, it stated, “Students of classes nine to 12 may be permitted to visit their schools, in areas outside containment zones only, on a voluntary basis, for taking guidance from their teachers.”On this line, the Jharkhand Education Project Council (JEPC) prepared a draft proposal for the secondary education wing for students of these classes.In its proposal, the council has suggested that only 20 students are to be allowed in a class on a given day, so that one student occupies a bench in a bid to maintain social distancing. As far as teachers are concerned, 50% of them could be allowed as per the roster.However, the secondary education wing has not forwarded the proposal to the disaster management department yet.Secondary education director Jatashankar Choudhary said, “We have not taken any such decision regarding reopening of the schools and we have not sent any proposal to the disaster management department in this regard.”An official of the education department said schools would remain closed till September 30. Any decision in this regard would be taken after assessing all necessary points, he said.It is to be noted that state education and literacy department had sought feedback from parents regarding reopening of schools and syllabus for students of classes nine to 12 between August 24 and 31. As many as 25.76% of the parents wanted schools to be reopened only in September, while 31.74% expressed willingness that classes be resumed after introduction of Covid-19 vaccine.
Updated: Sep 19, 2020 13:32 ISTYuvraj Singh will always be remembered fondly by cricket fans all around the world due to his achievements in the game. He was played a pivotal role in India’s triumph at the 2007 World T20 while being the man of the series at the 2011 Cricket World Cup. However, one of the most iconic moments in world cricket will always be Yuvraj hitting Stuart Broad for six sixes in an over at the 2007 T20 World Cup. It eventually led to India’s victory over England.That exact moment is still played on TV screens by Indian fans even though it happened 13 years ago in South Africa. Yuvraj’s name is forever etched in history. He scored his fifty of just 12 balls, which is still the fastest in the T20 format.In that match between India and England, the Men in Blue had won the toss and opted to bat first. Yuvi came out to bat when Robin Uthappa’s wicket fell and he provided the late flourish allowing India to post 218 runs on the board. India went on to win the match against England by 18 runs.READ| What does it take to succeed in the IPL?The Men in Blue were able to win the inaugural ICC T20 World Cup in 2007 and Yuvraj was a vital player for the team in the tournament.The 38-year-old was phenomenal in India’s World Cup triumph in 2011 as he became the first all-rounder to score over 300 runs and scalp 15 wickets in a single World Cup. The feat included four Man of the Match awards and Man of the Tournament for 362 runs and 15 wickets.Yuvraj has reportedly sent a mail to BCCI President Sourav Ganguly and Secretary Jay Shah, seeking their permission to come out of retirement. In his letter, he has made it clear that if he can play for Punjab, he will then not pursue options of playing in the global T20 leagues.The 2011 World Cup-winning hero has spent the past few months grooming the likes of Shubman Gill, Abhishek Sharma, Prabhsimran Singh, and Anmolpreet Singh at the PCA Stadium in Mohali.On June 10 last year, Yuvraj had announced his retirement from all forms of cricket. With a career spanning over 304 ODIs, 58 T20Is, and 40 Tests, Yuvraj cemented his place as a player who could win matches for his side either through his electric fielding, fierce batting, or smart bowling.(with ANI inputs)

All-rounder Chris Woakes expects players to be asked to take pay cuts after the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) announced 20 per cent reduction in its workforce to deal with the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.The ECB is grappling with a whopping 100-million pound loss as cricketing activities were disrupted due to the coronavirus outbreak. The amount could rise to 200 million pounds if the pandemic affects the 2021 summer.“It’s incredibly sad news, really. There’s a lot of people behind the scenes at the ECB who work incredibly hard, important cogs in the wheel,” Woakes told reporters. “At this moment of time, it is hard for me to say ‘we’re going to take X cuts, and there are going to be donations here, left right and centre’. Until we’ve seen what happens from above we’ll then get more of a feel for it. I certainly wouldn’t rule that out.ALSO READ: Jos Buttler a quality player but wrong to label him as England’s best ever in limited-overs: Rohan Gavaskar - EXCLUSIVE“In the current climate, with contracts around the corner, you have to expect anything. We have to wait and see, as players, you can’t say we’re exempt from it,” he added. The 31-year-old, who features for England in all three formats of the game, was thankful for the resumption of cricket in such testing times.“Of course it’s a sad time, and it does resonate with the players, but we’re also very fortunate that cricket has gone ahead this summer, that figure of £200 million could have been a lot worse. I suppose that is the only positive outcome, really,” Woakes said.“It is a situation where we have to sit down as players and see what happens with regards to these contracts coming up. We’ll know more in the next few weeks. We’ll reassess at that point,” he added.In April, centrally contracted players had voluntarily donated 500,000 pounds to the ECB and selected charities. The pacer said discussions on the issue are yet to take place between the board and the players.“That hasn’t really been discussed since and we haven’t been spoken to by the hierarchy of the ECB,” he said.
Alaya F seems to be taking a relaxing vacation in Goa. She took to Instagram to share a gorgeous photo of her chilling on a beach. In the picture, she is wearing a white cutout monokini, with her arms raised in the air. “F R E E D O M,” she captioned the post.“Ohhhh what a beautiful view with YOU in it,” one of her fan clubs commented, followed by a heart-eyes emoji. “Just stunning,” an Instagram user wrote. “Have a great holiday alaya. Looking fabulous ever,” another commented.In May, Alaya’s mother Pooja Bedi was in the eye of a storm after she tweeted about an ‘unhygienic’ quarantine facility in Goa, where she was put up after driving to the state with her fiancé Maneck Contractor. She shared another video, a few days later, in which she said Goa was her home. She hit back at Goans who were criticising her for travelling during the Covid-19 pandemic.Pooja clarified that they followed the necessary protocols and reminded everyone that Maneck is Goan. “His voter ID, Aadhaar card and his passport are registered to Goa. The homes that we possess and our properties are registered in Goa and our businesses are also registered in Goa. Goa is our home,” she said.Alaya, who made her Bollywood debut with Jawaani Jaaneman earlier this year, told Hindustan Times in May that she was forced to take a break almost immediately after her career in films began, thanks to the pandemic. “I definitely do miss working. My career just about started and I had to take a break instantaneously. I wish I could jump back into work. I love the feeling of being on a film set. I’ve been reading scripts during the lockdown. It’s great that I’m getting the time to read scripts,” she said.Jackky Bhagnani, who produced Jawaani Jaaneman under his banner Pooja Entertainment, has already signed Alaya for another film. She has also signed a three-film deal with Jay Shewakramani, who co-produced her debut film under his banner Northern Lights Films.
Dr Dhiman Barua, who died two months short of his 100th birthday, was a cholera and diarrhoeal diseases expert whose work on promoting oral rehydration salts (ORS) solution -- called “potentially the most important medical advance” of the 20th century by The Lancet -- is continuing to save millions of lives every year.Born to a family of doctors and traditional medicine practitioners in Rangoon, Burma (now Nay Pyi Taw in Myanmar), which was then a part of undivided India, his family moved to his ancestral village near Chittagong, then a part of undivided India, when he was four years old.A scholarship to study for a medical licence in Chittagong Medical School in the late 1930s changed his life, and he witnessed first-hand the effects of the Bengal famine. He held a short-commission posting during World War II and served in Malayasia, India and Burma with Indian Army Medical Corps.On his commanding officer’s advice, he joined Calcutta Medical College for a medical degree, did his doctoral work in Lucknow, followed by a postdoctoral fellowship at The Pasteur Institute in Paris and The London School of Tropical Medicine.Dr Barua began working for the World Health Organization in 1965 with the cholera control team based in Manila,and in 1966, he moved to the WHO head office in Geneva as a medical officer working on cholera and other diarrhoeal diseases. In 1978, he established the Diarrhoeal Diseases Control Programme, under which health workers were trained in the use of ORS to save lives.“My first memory of cholera was when I was eleven. The village in what is today Bangladesh was dying of cholera. I asked the doctor why and he told me that the only treatment was intravenous saline (IV) and that, without it, people die. And before my eyes, the doctor, his wife – who was related to me – and their two daughters died. Our household was not affected, but most households in the village were affected. People died like flies. That was really shocking,” he said in an interview to WHO in 2009.Till the late 60s, intravenous (IV) saline in glass bottles was the standard treatment for cholera and diarrhoeal disease. “A one-litre bottle was so heavy that to transport it by air was many times more expensive than the fluid itself. These circumstances obliged us think about alternatives to IV fluid in oral rehydration,” said Dr Barua, who, along with Dr Dilip Mahalanabis at the Johns Hopkins International Center for Medical Research and Training in Kolkata, struggled for years to convince sceptical clinicians that ORS could be administered by people with no medical training.Things changed at the end of 1970, when a Swiss company succeeded in packaging the ingredients in aluminium foil bags to prevent absorption of moisture and caking of the powder. Dr Barua described this a great discovery, because of long shelf life and easy transportation, without which they would never have succeeded.“After retirement, he embraced IT and with the help of many helping hands, taught himself to read more widely online and enjoyed keeping meticulous notes based on his inquisitive pursuit of knowledge for knowledge’s sake. He developed a dementing illness in the last years of his life, but he steadfastly maintained a cheerful attitude to his devastating loss of autonomy,” said his son Dr Basab Barua, a retired general physician who lives in Windsor, UK.
Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar has picked a pretty safe Mumbai Indians Playing XI, where he’s picked its skipper Rohit Sharma to open the innings along with Suryakumar Yadav, followed by Quinton de Kock at 3. Gavaskar picked the young wicketkeeper batsman Ishan Kishan to bat at No. 4, followed by the likes of Hardik Pandya, Kieron Pollard and Krunal Pandua at 4, 5 and 6.Having selected three fast bowlers in Jasprit Bumrah, Trent Boult and Nathan Coulter-Nile, leg-spinner Rahul Chahar is the line specialist spinner in his MI line-up.Also Follow | IPL 2020 Full CoverageFour-time champions MI may start as one of the strongest sides or favourites to win the IPL 2020, but as per Gavaskar, the team is grappling a couple of concerns ahead of their title defence. Gavaskar believes MI may struggle in two departments, one of which is a lack of experienced spinners.Also Read | Champs Mumbai keep the faith in openers Sharma, De KockAnd rightly so. MI have Chahar as the only specialist spinner, while all-rounder Pandya and Anukul Roy are more than capable of picking up wickets. But on surfaces of Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Sharjah, which have traditionally assisted spin, just how well MI manages their spinners will be interesting to see.Also Read | ‘Finishing doesn’t just fall on Hardik’: Jayawardena explains Pandya’s ‘different role’ in Mumbai Indians“Yes, you can say that because they do not have the experienced spinners that other sides have,” Sunil Gavaskar told Sports Tak.Besides a lack of depth in their spin department, Gavaskar has raised concerns over their middle-order. MI boasts a strong middle order with the likes of Pollard, Yadav, the Pandya brothers and Ishan Kishan in their ranks, but what Gavaskar feels might cause a bit of dilemma is deciding the positions they’re going to bat at.“The other thing that can be a weakness is middle order. They will have to think who will bat at No.4 and No.5 position. If Quinton de Kock plays, then he will open with either Rohit Sharma or Suryakumar Yadav,” Gavaskar added.“Ishan Kishan might come in at No.4, he can also open the innings. Kieron Pollard can come in at No.5. Maybe Hardik Pandya can be promoted to No.4. But if that doesn’t happen then who will play at No.4?”Sunil Gavaskar’s MI Playing XI: Rohit Sharma (c), Suryakumar Yadav, Quinton de Kock (wk), Ishan Kishan, Hardik Pandya, Kieron Pollard, Krunal Pandya, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Rahul Chahar, Trent Boult/Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah.
A demand for the government escalating its engagements with the international media to build a global opinion against Pakistan for sponsoring cross-border terrorism and harbouring fugitives such as Dawood Ibrahim was made in the Rajya Sabha on Saturday.Through a Zero Hour mention, Sasmit Patra of the BJD said the government should also engage with the G-8 nations to increase international pressure on Pakistan just like its engagement with the US that reflected in the recent Indo-US joint asking Pakistan to ensure that no territory under its control is used for terrorist activities.With international pressure building and also in an attempt to come out from the Financial Action Task Force’s grey list, Pakistan recently banned 88 terrorists including Hafiz Saeed, Masood Azhar and Dawood Ibrahim.Patra said while the Indian media has reported on the address and the assets of Dawood Ibrahim in Pakistan, the international media hasn’t done that.The government should “escalate matter through engagement with international media”, he said, adding it should also use Parliamentarian just as the US administration associates with senators.BSP Rajya Sabha member Rajaram raised the issue of only two per cent reservation being provided to the OBCs and eight per cent to the SCs in Jammu.This despite the OBCs constituting 35 per cent of the population in the region and the SCs 17 per cent, he said. BSP supremo Mayawati had supported the government on the scrapping of Article 370 in August last year in hope that central policies such as that on reservation will get fully implemented in Jammu and Kashmir, he said.But even after more than a year, the reservation for OBCs is stuck at two per cent and that for SCs at eight per cent, well below the national average, he said.Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu asked Minister of State for Home Affairs G Kishan Reddy to find out if the reason for the delay was administrative or due to pending census.Priyanka Chaturvedi of the Shiv Sena sought that relaxation in the age limit for candidates from reserved categories in educational institutions and jobs be also extended to those from the economically weaker sections (EWS).The EWS is provided 10 per cent reservation but no relaxation in the age limit is given to them, she said.Derek O’Brien (TMC) wanted the Central government to replicate the West Bengal model of paying cash to artists and artisans to support the informal sector ahead of the festive season.Neeraj Shekhar (BJP) demanded inclusion of the Bhojpuri language in the 8th Schedule as it is spoken by 20 crore people in India and 7-8 crore in countries such as Mauritius, the Maldives, Uganda, Surinam and Nepal.Ahmed Patel of the Congress sought the constitution of a task force to frame rules for conducting online classes for schoolchildren and provide help to those from the weaker sections of society who cannot afford digital education mediums such as computers or smartphones.K J Alphons (BJP) wanted the government to not slow down the fight against TB because of the coronavirus pandemic, and instead intensify tracking for Tuberculosis cases. YS Chowdary (BJP) sought measures for water conservation and management to avoid future catastrophe. PTI ANZ ANZ TIR TIR
I am not a film buff. If someone praises a movie, I might make an effort to catch it, but there are more good films I miss than I get to see. That’s as true of Hollywood as it is of Bollywood or any other cinematographic forest for that matter!However, I definitely know what I want from a film. A gripping story, moving acting, a few pretty faces and heart-stirring emotions. When I get all of that, I’m riveted to the screen. It’s impossible to distract me. If, in addition, it’s a tear-jerker, I’m quickly reduced to floods. There are many movies I’ve cried through, even in cinema halls with people looking sideways and wondering what’s going on.Well, there’s a movie I saw last Sunday which has all of this and a lot more. It’s called Mee Raqsam. That’s Urdu for “I Dance”. It’s a simple gentle story that overwhelms you as the film plays out. Even though it has a heroic ending, the anguish and anger you feel is never totally erased. It’s still there when your tears of rage turn to tears of happiness as the credits start to roll.Mee Raqsam is the story of a young Muslim girl, born and brought up in an Uttar Pradesh village called Mijwan, who has a fascination for Bharatanatyam and wants to learn the dance. In the eyes of the village’s Muslim elders, this is heresy. In fact, for them it’s tantamount to a betrayal of Islam and the honour of the Muslim community. On the other hand, the Hindu patron of the Bharatanatyam academy she joins is no less hard and cruel. For him little Mariam’s passion is proof that Hindu culture will triumph over Islam. That’s what matters to him. Not her talent nor her story.Fortunately, Mariam’s father, a widowed village tailor, brilliantly played by Danish Hussain, is loving, understanding and supportive, even when the community, including his late wife’s family, turn their backs on him. His business suffers and shrivels but his support for his 10-year-old daughter never falters.There are times when this story has echoes of Billy Elliot, an enchanting story of a Yorkshire coalminer’s son who defies the pit community’s traditions and learns ballet. Both films can be viewed as commentaries on the prejudices of their times. To an Indian audience, the British film may feel distant but Baba Azmi’s Mee Raqsam will not. It tellingly illustrates and illuminates the deepening Hindu-Muslim fissures that seem to be tearing our country apart.Yet, I would say the strength of Mee Raqsam is not what it says of our attitudes and our society — though it speaks about that very eloquently — but what it reveals of the love between a father and his daughter. This precious relationship is treated without false sentimentality and, mercifully, without the Hollywood habit of overegging the story.It’s the little things in life that can mean so much and that’s why it’s the little moments of affection — the look on a face, the touch of a hand, the smile on a little girl’s lips — that can move you to tears. Love is a big story and it has no ending but the paradox is it’s best told with just a few words and the occasional expression. That’s where this movie becomes a masterpiece.I suspect the makers and promoters of this film — and the list has Shabana Azmi’s name at the very top — intended for the movie’s political message to be the one the audience takes home. No doubt it’s an important one. It needs to be heard and repeated. Indeed, even that might not be enough. But when you see the movie, it’s the beauty and magic of the love between a father and his daughter that you are bound to remember. Politics recedes, as it always should. Love triumphs as, hopefully, it always will.If you take my advice and see this movie, I don’t think you’ll regret doing so.Karan Thapar is the author of Devil’s Advocate: The Untold StoryThe views expressed are personal
Updated: Sep 16, 2020 20:51 ISTA new university will be set up at Villupuram by bifurcating the state-run Vellore based Thiruvalluvar varsity, Chief Minister K Palaniswami announced in the Assembly on Wednesday.The new university would start functioning from the current academic year, he said, adding the move follows Villupuram people’s long time request in addition to the plea of Law Minister C Ve Shanmugam who hails from the region.Late Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa gave importance to higher education and established a slew of colleges including arts, polytechnic and engineering, he recalled.Continuing in her footsteps, the government carried on with the initiative to set up new institutions besidesupgrading the infrastructure of existing facilities.In view of such initiatives, the Gross Enrolment Ratio in Tamil Nadu stood at 49 per cent, while the national average was 26.3 per cent, he noted.Replying to DMK deputy leader Duraimurugan on splitting the Thiruvallur varsity, Palaniswami said Villupuram was backward and the move wasaimed at facilitating higher education of students from that region.Administration would be more efficient only if universities were restructured in keeping with the establishment of more and more affiliating colleges, he said.In Tamil Nadu, there are at least 20 state run universities including separate ones for medicine, law, sports, fisheries and music.
Indian shares rose on Monday, boosted by IT stocks after HCL Technologies raised its outlook for the September quarter, while small- and mid-cap names were helped by a change in asset allocation norms for multi-cap funds.The NSE Nifty 50 index climbed 0.74% to 11,549.2 by 0507 GMT and the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex 0.83% to 39,172.76, both heading for their third straight session of gains.India’s markets regulator said on Friday multi-cap funds must invest at least 25% each in large-cap, mid-cap and small-cap stocks, boosting the Nifty Smallcap 100 by 5.3%, and the Nifty Midcap 50 Index by 2.2%.The watchdog, however, clarified https://www.sebi.gov.in/media/press-releases/sep-2020/clarification-pursuant-to-circular-dated-september-11-2020-regarding-asset-allocation-of-multi-cap-schemes-of-mutual-funds_47546.html on Sunday that mutual funds were free to choose the route to comply with those norms.“People are anticipating that 300-400 billion rupees ($9.54 billion) of buying will happen in mid- and small-caps after the norms because of under-allocation in these stocks,” said Harendra Kumar, managing director of institutional equities at Elara Capital.IT firm HCL Technologies Ltd was the biggest percentage gainer on the Nifty, jumping 6.6% to a record high, after it upgraded revenue and operating margin outlook for the September quarter.That gave a fillip to other IT stocks, pushing the Nifty IT index 3% higher to an all-time peak.Reliance Industries Ltd rose 1.7% to a record high after local daily Mint reported that private equity firm Carlyle Group was looking to invest up to $2 billion in the conglomerate’s retail business.Aiding sentiment, AstraZeneca resumed clinical trials of its COVID-19 vaccine, one of the most advanced in development, after getting the green light from safety watchdogs, pushing Asian shares higher on Monday.Investors are also eyeing inflation data due later in the day, with the number likely to have stayed above the Reserve Bank of India’s medium-term target range in August for the fifth straight month, according to a Reuters poll.
His sabbatical from the game has done Mahendra Singh Dhoni a world of good, Chennai Super Kings coach Stephen Fleming said on Friday, asserting that the enigmatic skipper is “mentally engaged and determined” to encounter the challenges of a “tactically different” IPL.Dhoni’s CSK will take on Rohit Sharma’s Mumbai Indians in the tournament opener on Saturday. Fleming, a former New Zealand captain, stressed that his team’s experience of winning big matches will come in handy during the next 53 days. (Also Read | Full coverage of IPL 2020)Dhoni retired from international cricket last month after being on a break for over one year and when asked about the 39-year-old’s preparedness for the IPL, Fleming said, “It has been no different. He’s very fit and mentally, he’s been very engaged and determined.”“In some ways the break can work for the experienced and older players that we have. MS is fresh and ready to go,” Fleming said in a pre-tournament interview to CSK’s official website.The three-time champions are banking heavily on their 35-plus players, including Dhoni himself, Shane Watson, Dwayne Bravo, Kedar Jadhav, and Imran Tahir to name a few.Also Read | Dhoni faces Mumbai Indians puzzle again, can CSK end poor run of losses?“...experienced players identify key times and that’s why they’ve done so well in their careers. They can turn games, absorb pressure or just sum out the situation. That’s what experience is about and that’s why we value it so highly,” said Fleming.“And that’s why we’ve been able to get over the line in so many close games because the key player has been one with a lot of experience. And you also mix that with skill. You are conscious of having a skilful side and adding youth when we can and with that get the balance pretty right.”Assessing the track correctly at Abu Dhabi is another factor considering it is slightly different in nature from Dubai and Sharjah.“It’s one of the challenges of having to travel to Abu Dhabi, we’ve got to have to be very good on the day to have to assess the wicket and pick the right combination. One of the big challenges for IPL teams is to get the combinations right.“Picking the right side for the right conditions is one of the great challenges and we’ve got a good record at that. But I must admit, going to Abu Dhabi without seeing the wicket or assessing the conditions is going to be one of the big challenges to start with,” he concluded.
Former India batsman, captain and chairman of selectors Dilip Vengsarkar is known for his strong and erudite views about the game. When it comes to Indian cricket, Vengsarkar never minces his words and says what he feels.With the Indian Premier League all set for its 13th edition, Vengsarkar feels more IPL franchises should go for Indian coaches rather than opting for foreign stars. Currently Kings XI Punjab are the only team that has an Indian as its head coach. The franchise is being coached by former India legend Anil Kumble.ALSO READ: Gautam Gambhir explains why Mumbai Indians have ‘upper hand’ against Chennai Super Kings ahead of opening game“I believe more Indian coaches should coach the IPL teams simply because they have the experience; they have also been coaching the states exceedingly well. Besides, how many Indian coaches are coaching teams in other countries’ league like Australia’s Big Bash, etc.? We find none. So why should we hire foreign coaches? I feel our coaches are equally good and some of them are even better. It’s time we give more opportunity to Indian coaches, I am sure they will do exceedingly well. Hopefully, IPL teams will have more Indian coaches than foreign coaches,” Vengsarkar was quoted as saying by Gulf news.The topic of few Indian head coaches in the IPL came under the spotlight recently when Kumble himself spoke about the issue.“I can’t answer that question (why other teams don’t have Indian head coaches). I don’t think it gives a true reflection of the quality or the availability of the Indian resources. It’s bit of an irony right? It’s the Indian Premier League and then you have only one Indian as the head coach. I am hopeful that there will be more Indian coaches in the mix,” said Kumble during an interaction from Dubai last week.ALSO READ: Global cricket still needs an icon like MS Dhoni to continue: Former India wicket-keeperThe remaining seven IPL franchises have foreigners as head coaches: Brendon McCullum (Kolkata Knight Riders); Ricky Ponting (Delhi Capitals); Andrew McDonald (Rajasthan Royals); Mahela Jayawardene (Mumbai Indians); Trevor Bayliss (Sunrisers Hyderabad); Stephen Fleming (Chennai Super Kings) and Simon Katich (Royal Challengers Bangalore).Prior to Kumble, only three Indians have coached in IPL: Lalchand Rajput (MI), Robin Singh (SRH) and Venkatesh Prasad (RCB).“The reason I have taken up this assignment with KXIP is that we have great a squad to go all the way. That’s my role, to prepare the team. This is first time I am meeting the squad. Because of Covid, we have got to spend a longer time with the team. Otherwise, it’s just one week before the tournament,” said Kumble had said..
The 2003 World Cup match between India and England saw a sensational bowling effort from seamer Ashish Nehra. The former India pacer picked up six wickets in the match as England were bundled out for 168 in 251-run chase in Durban. Nehra dismissed England captain Nasser Hussain, Micahel Vaughan, Alec Stewart, Paul Collingwood, Craig White and Ronnie Irani in the match. But while the records are written in the history books, the events behind the scenes are rarely discussed.Former India cricketer Aakash Chopra, on Tuesday, recalled how Nehra had a heavily swollen leg a day before the encounter due to an injury, and had to play the entire game with the injury.Speaking in his latest video uploaded on his official Facebook page, Chopra said: “World Cup 2003, India vs England on Durban pitch. It was a close contest. England were at 52/2 chasing 250. Ashish Nehra came into the attack. He takes a great run-up, gets a leading edge off from the bat and England captain Nasser Hussain had to return to the pavilion. Great breakthrough. Then, came Alex Tudor (It was Paul Collingwood). He got out LBW. Michael Vaughan was caught behind. With this, half of England’s team fell down like a pack of cards. The Indian lions roared.“But wait, you know this story, already right? Let me take you to the flashback, behind the scenes. This heavily swollen leg kept inside a bucket of ice... who is it? This is the same Ashish Nehra who, the very next day, stepped out on the field to rattle England batting unit with a swollen leg. As we say, there is nothing greater than a person’s will. Not even injuries. If Nehra ji has decided that he will play against England, then no one can stop him,” Chopra recalled.“So, Nehra filled a buck full of ice, and kept his heavily swollen leg inside the bucket for hours. The next day, he heavily taped and bandaged his swollen leg, and wore thick, tight socks. Even though, it was even difficult for him to wear his shoes, he still got ready, stood up and went off to the field. With Dada’s faith in him, and his self-believe, Nehra ji achieved wonders which no one expected.“Nehra took a 6-wicket haul - a feat which no other Indian bowler has been able to achieve during a World Cup game. The thing to remember here is that the records will continue to be broken. The real story is that of the passion, and not giving up. An injury can affect your body, but not your determination. Long Live, Nehra ji,” Chopra signed off.Nehra retired from international cricket in 2017, having played 17 Tests, 120 ODIs and 27 T20Is for India.
How the Congress party deals with the current crisis will prove who was right: Those who argued that the Congress must perish or those who believe that the party still remains the best available option to challenge the hegemony of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)?It must first ask itself whether the demands made by the signatories of the letter to Congress president, Sonia Gandhi, are legitimate. The letter from 23 senior leaders of the Congress seemed a genuine attempt to draw attention to the fast-eroding support base of the party, especially among younger voters. It highlighted the leadership challenge, and made recommendations for organisational rejuvenation. And given that several of these signatories come from diverse social segments, with considerable political experience, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to suggest that many within the party (even those who rallied behind the Gandhi family) share the sentiments in the letter. No one, either during the Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting or in television debates, has criticised the content of the letter. The criticisms were limited to the timing and the motives of the signatories.After the showdown at the CWC meeting on August 24, there are four possible scenarios. And it seems the Congress party has opted for the least preferred outcome.First, Rahul Gandhi takes over as the president in the next All India Congress Committee (AICC) meeting and promises to take up the demands made by the signatories. This would be the most optimal outcome. However, the optimal outcome is rarely the eventual outcome in politics as the game not only involves strategic decisions, but a range of other variables. In such a situation, shallow loyalties may be rewarded and even mild criticism would be unacceptable.Second, there is a split in the party. With most formal positions held by pro-Gandhi family camp, it is almost impossible for dissenters to force the Gandhis to step aside. But the pro-Gandhi camp cannot also go for indiscriminate purging, as some signatories are heavyweights and may well walk out of the party. However, it is unlikely that there will be any major vertical split in the Congress in the near future. There is little possibility of a 1969 or a 1977 sort of national split as a large section of the Congress base still associates the party with the Gandhi family. Furthermore, during the two national splits earlier, it was a Gandhi leading the rebellion against the party.Today, there is not a single leader within the party who can mobilise voters across states or has the resources to sustain such a formation in a lean period. There are a few who can do so in their respective states though.Why does India’s grand old party no longer have enough leaders with a substantial mass base and how did the Gandhi family become synonymous with the party? Though this history is well known, it is worth reiterating. The increasing interference of the Congress high command in state politics during the Indira Gandhi (and Rajiv Gandhi) years neutralised the emergence of independent centres of power within the party. State leaders were appointed (or dismissed) by the high command in a whimsical manner. The unwillingness to nurture strong state leaders allowed the Gandhi family to stay pre-eminent in the party.Third, the Gandhis decide that no one from the family will be party president, and ask for a non-Gandhi to lead the party. This is not an easy option. Will the new president be given the space to act as an independent centre of authority? Will the new leader be free from pulls and pressures if the Gandhis continue to play favourites? Will the new leadership have the full support of the party cadres across the country? And, what about the fear among many that the Congress will fragment if a non-Gandhi leads the party?And fourth, a policy of active marginalisation of dissenters is pursued. The composition of new party committees for the two Houses last week, in particular the selection of Gaurav Gogoi of the Gandhi camp as the deputy leader in the Lok Sabha over other senior figures who dissented, suggests this is the most likely course of action. This is not a fruitful option as all sides are likely to lose, but this appears to be the direction the party is taking. The Congress has opted to drift along without tackling the crisis head-on. Perhaps we may witness more examples of people expressing dissatisfaction with the state of affairs in the party with greater frequency. But it is unlikely that there will be a coup d’etat or ruthless purging. As serious restructuring and re-imagination of the political agenda seem unlikely, political attrition will become a norm. Some leaders may join the BJP, others may go to regional outfits as in the case of Tripura.What does the Congress need to do to overcome this state of inertia? The party leadership must realise that whatever the party’s projections of its electoral strength, in reality, the party is getting marginalised. It can no longer continue in the belief that it is an umbrella party with a national presence. The party needs to make a realistic assessment of what revival means for it. In any state, where the party has slid to the third or fourth position, be it Uttar Pradesh or Bihar, West Bengal or Tamil Nadu, it has never recovered. With depleting resources to contest against the BJP machine nationally, the absence of a popular acceptable face to take on Narendra Modi, organisational atrophy, ideological confusion, and formidable challengers in many states, it must act wisely and urgently.Rahul Verma is a fellow at the Centre for Policy Research (CPR), New DelhiThe views expressed are personal
Flipkart may go public as early as next year at a valuation of $40-45 billion, a person familiar with the development said, as India’s largest online retailer benefits from accelerated adoption of digital platforms for shopping and payments by customers because of the coronavirus pandemic.Flipkart would look at an overseas listing, either in the US, where its parent Walmart Inc. is based, or another country, the person said on condition of anonymity. Walmart had in 2018 acquired a majority stake in Flipkart for $16 billion, valuing the Bengaluru-based company at $21 billion. At that time, Doug McMillion, president and CEO of Walmart, said that Flipkart will go public within four years of closing the deal. “The IPO should be done at no less a valuation than that at which Walmart invested in the Indian e-commerce firm,” Walmart had then said in a regulatory filing.“As per Walmart’s timeline, the IPO could be done by 2022. But the digital transformation in India, with customers increasingly moving online to shop, has been so rapid, that it has made Flipkart grow much faster. Therefore the IPO plan could also be fast-tracked. Flipkart would get the best valuation if the IPO happens in the US,” the person said on the condition of anonymity. A Flipkart spokesperson did not respond to emailed queries. Reuters first reported the news about Flipkart’s IPO plans earlier in the day. In July, Walmart led a $1.2 billion investment in Flipkart Group, valuing the company at around $25 billion, in its largest fund-raising since its acquisition in 2018. In India, Flipkart competes with Amazon and Reliance Retail, which has been ramping up its JioMart e-commerce business. Flipkart’s subsidiary, PhonePe, is also looking to turn profitable by 2022 and go public by 2023. Mint first reported on PhonePe’s IPO plans on April 22. The digital payments company, which competes with Paytm, Google Pay and Amazon Pay, is most likely to go public in the US at a valuation of $10 billion.Recently, Flipkart, as a part of its funding announcement from Walmart, said PhonePe is currently processing annualized total payments value of $180 billion, and witnesses more than 500 million transactions each month on its platform. It looks to exit 2020 with more than 275 million users on its platform.“The focus of Flipkart, however, is growth right now, and the IPO timeline is not fixed yet. But the global guidance and Walmart’s acquisition was to always create the right processes and build the company to eventually take it public,” said a second person.
Updated: Sep 11, 2020 13:52 ISTTesla is planning to export Model 3 vehicles made in China to Asian and European markets, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday.The U.S. automaker, which started delivering Model 3 electric sedans from its Shanghai factory in December, also plans from next year to sell China-made Model 3 vehicles to Japan and Hong Kong, one of the sources said.Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The U.S. firm is expanding its manufacturing capacity in China to make Model Y sports-utility vehicles (SUVs) and adding lines to make more battery packs, electric motors and motor controllers.Tesla, which aims to build 150,000 Shanghai-made Model 3 vehicles this year, sold about 11,800 vehicles in China last month.The sources declined to be named as they are not allowed to speak to media. Bloomberg reported the plan earlier on Friday.
There is a clamour to postpone all exams including the JEE and NEET exams which are essential to ensure merit-based admissions in engineering and medical institutions across the country. For several days, various newspapers, TV channels and the digital media have been reporting arguments to postpone these exams. A few days back, chief ministers of several opposition-ruled states joined hands to demand the postponement of the JEE and NEET examinations and decided that they will jointly approach the Supreme Court in this regard. Those who want the exams postponed argue that in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, holding the exams will adversely affect the health of students and will increase the spread of the virus. They also argue that the restrictions on public transport due to coronavirus would make it difficult for many aspirants to reach the examination centers. Their demand is to defer the exams till at least November by when the virus situation is hoped to improve.The issue of postponement of exams was agitated before the Supreme Court also, which after hearing all the interested parties, declined to intervene in the matter and ordered that these exams be conducted as per schedule. The government was also directed to take all necessary precautions for the safe conduct of these exams. The Supreme Court, in another matter on Friday, decided that universities must go through with the examinations of final-year students and gave the freedom to universities to devise the schedule as per their convenience. Now, various opposition-ruled states have filed review petitions before the Supreme Court for postponement of the JEE and NEET exams.There is no doubt that these are extraordinary times and fear of coronavirus is looming large everywhere. At present, India is reporting the highest numbers of daily coronavirus infections in the world and the number of deaths occurring every day due to the virus is also the highest. So the arguments advanced by groups pushing for postponement of the exams have some merits. But if we look from the other side, the arguments advanced by the government also look weighty. These exams have been postponed twice earlier due to the same reasons. Time has now come to take a final call on holding these exams as any further delay may result in completely disrupting the current academic session for lakhs of students.The biggest fallacy of the arguments advanced by those demanding the postponement of the exams is that by November, things are likely to improve on the coronavirus front. We may recall that many experts had opined that virus infection numbers would peak sometime in July or August. We are nearing the end of August and so far, we do not seem to have succeeded in reversing the corona curve. Who can predict that our country will become safe to conduct these exams in November? And if we fail to conduct these exams, then? Surely then the whole academic session will be jeopardised as there will hardly be sufficient time left to complete the academic session.The government of the day has the responsibility to weigh the pros and cons of the issue, see the problem in a holistic manner and take a call in the wider interest of the students and the country. The government has the primary responsibility to not only ensure the conduct of these exams but also the smooth running of educational institutions as well as the health and safety of all those who are going to appear in these exams and to further see that these exams do not in any way result in the further spread of the virus. There is no doubt that only the students are going to be the losers in case of curtailment or zero academic session. Keeping in mind all these factors , the government has to ensure that the exams are conducted in a fully-secure environment with no danger to the health of students and others.Almost six months into the pandemic, the country has learned to live with the virus.During the past few months, most economic activities barring the tourism industry, cinema halls etc. have been opened with some restrictions. Similarly, trains, buses, taxis, and other modes of travel have been allowed. Factories , shops , industrial units, offices have started functioning after following standard operating procedures. It is now confirmed by experts that wearing masks in public places is the surest way of avoiding getting infected, in addition to using sanitizers and maintaining physical distancing. The government has to ensure that all the students and organizers observe these precautions scrupulously.Let us remember that across the world, people have devised their own indigenous solutions for carrying on their activities in all walks of life, so we should also. As our Supreme court has rightly opined that the country has to carry on despite the pandemic and hence these exams. The time has come to move forward, in the larger interest of our nation, rising above narrow political gimmicks. “Jaan hai to jahan hai “ is an old saying , we have to ensure “Jaan bhi jahaan bhi”(VS Pandey is a former IAS officer. He retired as secretary, department of fertilisers in the Government of India)
The beleaguered Telugu Desam Party in Andhra Pradesh received yet another setback on Saturday when another lawmaker Vasupalli Ganesh from Visakhapatnam shifted loyalties to the ruling YSR Congress party.The TDP legislator representing Visakhapatnam (South) assembly constituency met YSRC president and chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy at the latter’s camp office in Tadepalli in Amaravati in the afternoon and extended his support to the ruling party.Ganesh, however, did not officially join the YSRC, apparently to avoid being disqualified from his assembly membership under the Anti-Defection Law. However, he got his two sons admitted into the YSRC.A businessman by profession, Ganesh entered politics in 2009 and unsuccessfully contested the assembly elections on a TDP ticket. However, he won the elections in 2014 and 2019 and had been loyal to the TDP for a long time.However, for the last few months, Ganesh has been differing with the stand taken by party president and former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu opposing the shifting of administrative capital of the state from Amaravati to Visakhapatnam.Speaking to reporters later, Ganesh described Jagan as a dynamic leader and said he was confident that the state would achieve progress under the latter’s leadership. “The welfare schemes launched by the Jagan government have been attracting people and I don’t think the TDP can make any headway in the future,” he said.The MLA hoped that he would be able to take up several developmental work in his constituency during the Jagan regime. “We shall strive to win in the Mayoral elections and present it as a gift to Jagan,” he said.Ganesh is the fourth MLA to leave the TDP in the last 15 months. Earlier, Gannavaram MLA Vallabhaneni Vamsi Mohan and Guntur (West) MLA Maddali Giridhar also distanced themselves from the TDP and announced their support to the YSRC.With this, the strength of the TDP in the 175-member assembly has come down to 19. Technically, however, the strength of the TDP remains 23, as the three MLAs did not officially quit the TDP to avoid getting disqualified.All the three defected MLAs have been allocated separate seats in the assembly by Speaker Tammineni Sitaram, following their request. Ganesh is also likely to follow the same procedure.In the last few months, several senior leaders like MLCs Dokka Manikya Varaprasada Rao, Pothula Sunitha and D Sivanath Reddy, former deputy chairman of legislative Council S V Satish Reddy, former minister P Ramasubba Reddy, former MLAs Panchakarla Ramesh Babu, Kadiri Babu Rao, Thota Trimurthulu Beeda Mastan Rao and S A Rahman and former MLC Jupudi Prabhakar Rao, had quit the party and joined the YSRC.
The UP Board’s High School and Intermediate Improvement/Compartment Examinations will be held on October 3. According to the schedule released by the Board, the exams will be held in two shifts: 8am to 11.15am and 2pm to 5.15pm.UP Board secretary Divyakant Shukla said that 33,344 candidates including 15,839 High school and 17,505 Intermediate students will appear in these exams across the state. The board had accepted online applications for these exams between August 5 and August 20, he added.The exams are scheduled to be held at around 163 centres spread across the state including 82 centres for high school students, 81 centres for intermediate students, board officials explained.In view of the increasing cases of Coronavirus, extra care will be taken at all examination centres. There will be a distance of at least six feet between two examinees. Examinees exhibiting symptoms of fever, dry cough, etc, will be made to sit in separate rooms. The guidelines issued by the central and state government will be enforced by the district inspectors of schools (DIOSs) at all centres. Proper sanitisation will be carried out at each centre a day before the exam. It will be mandatory for every examinee to also wear a mask, officials clarified.DIOSs will arrange for facemasks for those students who arrive at a centre without facemasks. Thermal scanning of candidates and staff will also be compulsorily carried out at the entrance, they added.It will be compulsory for centre managers, teachers, non-teaching staff to also wear masks at the time of the examination.This is the first time that students of Intermediate have been provided the option to appear in compartment exams by the UP Board.The Board had announced its High School and Intermediate exam-2020 results on June 27. Around 35,017 Intermediate students had done badly in one subject across the state and were eligible to appear in the maiden Class 12 compartment exams of the board. In High School, 3,27,663 had done badly in one subject. But they were issued pass certificates as per the norm. However, they were eligible to appear in an improvement exam and pass the exam for the subject they had failed. Around 771 High School students had failed in two subjects this time and were eligible to appear in compartment exam in any one of the two subjects that they had failed and consequently get a pass certificate.

The wheels of Kolkata Metro started rolling again with passengers on Sunday after nearly six months with special services for NEET examinees and their guardians.Regular passenger services will commence on Monday with social distancing measures and other safety protocols in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, a Metro official said.NEET aspirants, many accompanied by their guardians, queued up in front of metro stations to reach their examination centres well before 10 am when the first trains started from both ends of the North-South line -- Noapara and Kavi Subhash.The examinees and their guardians were allowed inside the stations upon showing the admit cards to police personnel posted at the entry gates.The candidates and their guardians went through thermal checking and sanitised their hands before buying paper tickets at the counters.The special services will continue till 7 pm at intervals of 15 minutes, officials said.Regular passenger services on the North-South and the East-West lines will commence on Monday.Officials said that 110 trains will be operated on the North-South line every day, except Sundays when the services will be shut for sanitisation of rakes and stations.The East-West Metro will also recommence services from September 14 between Sector V and Yuva Bharati Krirangan stations with 36 trains in each direction, they said.
The ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) has sought responses from the ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) and the Uttarakhand government about the alleged violations of the forest conservation act during the construction of the Char Dham Pariyojana in Uttarakhand. The ₹12,000-crore Pariyojana, which was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in December 2016, aims to build an 889-km all-weather road, connecting the Hindu pilgrimage sites of Kedarnath, Badrinath, Yamunotri and Gangotri in the Himalayas. The issue of environmental violations in the project is being heard by the Supreme Court (SC), and the case is due to come up on September 8.While there has been criticism of the project on environmental grounds (recent landslides in the state prove once again that it is risky to build in the ecologically-fragile zone), its plan of action illustrates how the Indian State has flouted procedures to push the project through. One, the government used a legal loophole to avoid conducting the mandatory Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), including public hearings, to fast-track the project. Two, official agencies refused to abide by SC orders on stoppage of work. And, three, it suppressed a MoRTH’s revised circular on the contentious issue of road standards in hilly and mountainous terrains to go ahead with its road-widening plans.This is not all: A senior Uttarakhand government official tried to mislead MoEFCC by sending an “altered” report to the ministry, bypassing Ravi Chopra, the chairman of the High Powered Committee (HPC) set up by SC to look into the project. This “subterfuge”, as Mr Chopra wrote it in his letter to the ministry, was conducted because five members of the panel felt that the project will cause “irreversible damage” to the Himalayan ecology, while 21 others (mostly government representatives) said that the ecological damage can be “minimised”. The Chopra report has said that the project is an “act of irresponsibility and disregard towards the Himalayas”, when it is becoming clearer that any development devoid of “honest and uncompromising ecological concerns” will bring “devastation and disaster on our heads”. The Centre must take the Chopra report seriously, review its stand on the need for broader roads, and conduct a carrying-capacity study of the area. The government’s stand will also define how serious it is about complying with green norms in general, and the larger issue of the climate crisis.
The phrase ‘taking a piss’ was used figuratively, at least up until Wednesday night, when American singer-songwriter and music producer, Kanye West, took it literally and presumably took a pi** on one his Grammys (out of the 21 that he has won in total) in the toilet, and posted a video of it on Twitter.Trust me ... I WONT STOP pic.twitter.com/RmVkqrSa4F — ye (@kanyewest) September 16, 2020The shocking video came after Yeezus went on a Twitter rant, accusing record labels of “trapping” musicians with their record deals and making “money off our work without even trying”.90% of the record contracts on the planet are still on a royalty A standard record deal is a trap to NEVER have you recoup, and there’s all these hidden costs like the "distribution fees" many labels put in their contracts to make even more money off our work without even trying. — ye (@kanyewest) September 16, 2020In his rant, West wrote accusing labels, particularly Universal Music, of owning the rights to the masters ( the primary source from where all the copies of a song are produced) of his songs. He also went to share his contracts, signed with the labels, asking it to be read by “every lawyer in the world”, and promised that he will produce no new music, until his demands are met.He also reached out to several musicians, including U2’s frontman Bono, former Beatles member Paul McCartney, Drake and “even Taylor (Swift)” to support him.Bono can I get a retweet Love you Paul can I get a retweet love you Drake Kendrick even Taylor We need you right noooooow ⛷ — ye (@kanyewest) September 16, 2020Netizens, as always, are still trying to come to grips with Yeezus’latest meltdown on social media.On the day his wife @KimKardashian boycotts Facebook/Instagram as a protest against hateful material on social media.. Kanye posts a video of (presumably) himself urinating on his Grammy.Beyond parody. 👇 https://t.co/aS1Stvg6RN — Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) September 16, 2020And, while some thought that the video, as pointed out by Grammy winner Dianne Warren, was “vile and disrespectful” , some called it a historic moment.I don’t care what you think about Kanye West... but pissing on a Grammy is one of the most symbolic and iconic things he’s ever done. https://t.co/QdYsXkdwf4 — mariano 🦦 (@TheRapAgenda) September 16, 2020Earlier this year, in July, in another Twitter rant, West had said that he was “trying to divorce” his wife, Kim Kardashian West. Kim, later posted a long message on Instagram, saying that Kanye was bipolar, which was also revealed by Kanye himself in 2018, requesting everybody to be kind and empathetic towards her “brilliant but complicated” husband.The same month, a few days before he accused Kim of cheating on him and him doing the same, he also had announced that he would be running for the Presidency, in the upcoming presidential elections in the US, which are scheduled to take place in November.
The finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday said that the government will not increase taxes on states to make up for the revenue losses incurred due to coronavirus pandemic.Nirmala Sitharaman said that the Centre is not going back on its promise of paying the Goods and Services Tax (GST) compensation to states, according to PTI. She said, “Even if we are in an act of God situation, but we will discuss in the Council how to give compensation to the states... The Council will take a call on how to borrow to meet the (revenue) gap.”Centre had given the option to the states two options where they could either borrow Rs 97,000 crore from via a RBI-facilitated special window or Rs 2.35 lakh crore from the market along with the extension of compensation cess levied on luxury, demerit and sin goods beyond 2022 to pay back the borrowed sum.States are facing a Rs 2.35 lakh crore shortfall in GST revenue this fiscal year.Sitharaman said that Opposition is hurling ‘irresponsible comments’ at a ‘responsible government’ and reiterated that Centre shall not renege on its promises made to states regarding compensation payment. She further added, “We are ready to discuss. We are taking everyone together and the Council will find a view. This is my optimistic expectation. The Centre is not reneging (from its commitment)”Sitharaman also took a dig at the Opposition for ridiculing her ‘Act of God’ remark. She asked the Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla that how come in courts the term ‘force majeure’ is acceptable to explain extraordinary circumstances but the term ‘Act of God’ has become an object of ridicule.She said, “Many people spoke on the GST compensation issue (and) my statement of Act of God was referred several times. I am happy (about) that. People like using latin expression (like) force majeure, for expressing extraordinary situations. But a simple woman finance minister saying the Act of God is taken sarcastically. What is this sir?”She further added, “I like this condescension.”The finance minister presented the The Supplementary Demands for Grants for 2020-21 and The Demands for Excess Grants for 2016-17 bills which were passed by the Lok Sabha.(with PTI inputs)
India should “immediately” correct its mistakes and disengage at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) as soon as possible, China said on Thursday, once again blaming New Delhi for the ongoing tension in eastern Ladakh.The Chinese foreign ministry said the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) troops always abide by the agreements between the two countries on maintaining peace and tranquility along the disputed boundary.It is imperative for India to immediately correct its wrong practices, disengage on the ground as soon as possible and take concrete actions to ease the tension along the China-India border, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at a ministry briefing.Chinese border troops, he said, have always “strictly” abided by the agreements between the two countries; they are committed to safeguarding China’s territorial sovereignty and maintaining peace and tranquility in border areas.On Wednesday, Wang had said China was not to blame for the ongoing crisis at the border, which has plunged bilateral ties to its worst levels in decades.“But China is not to blame for the current situation. It is the Indian side that has breached the agreements, first trespassed the territory first and fired shots to threaten the safety of the Chinese border troops first,” Wang said on Wednesday.The Indian government has already dismissed similar allegations made by the Chinese earlier, saying that PLA troops were the first to provoke and not ready to disengage.External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava clearly spelt out the Indian government’s position on the disengagement process earlier, saying the LAC “must be strictly respected and observed as this is the basis for peace and tranquility in the border areas”.Separately on Thursday, the nationalistic tabloid Global Times accused India of not being sincere in honouring the consensus to disengage in the backdrop of Thursday’s meeting of the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) national security advisors.The article said while the meeting is a good opportunity to ease the ongoing border tensions between China and India, it depends on India’s sincerity.National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Yang Jiechi, director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the CPC Central Committee, are expected to attend the BRICS video conference organised by Russia.Hu Zhiyong, from the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times that China should be prepared to face the fact that a consensus with India is possible if they meet, but should also remain vigilant over whether India can keep its promises.Zhao Gancheng, from the Shanghai Institute for International Studies, said since Yang and Doval know each other for a long time, the BRICS meeting brings hopes of peace.Zhao, however, added that whether the ultimate solution will be reached depends on India, as it has been showing no sign of conceding since the border standoff in May, and continues to provoke the PLA.
For the past six decades, Rajiv Gupta’s family has been selling school and college textbooks from their shop in Delhi’s Nai Sarak, one of the country’s biggest textbook markets. The shop, which saw a never-ending stream of students before the onset of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, hardly receives any customers these days.“These days, only a few parents come to buy books for their children. My sales have plummeted by 70% this year,” says Gupta.The continued closure of schools and other educational institutions due to the Coronavirus pandemic has dealt a blow to the textbook industry, with booksellers and publishers experiencing an unprecedented decline in their business after decades of robust growth.According to the India Book Market Report by Nielsen released in 2015, there were about 21,000 book retailers and about 9,000 publishers in India, out of which 8,107 published books for schools, colleges and higher educational institutions. Educational books formed about 70% of the book market in India — with the school and college books market valued at ₹18,600 crore and ₹5,600 crore respectively in 2013–14. According to the report, the K-12 books market was likely to grow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate of 19.6%, from ₹22,170 crore in 2014-15 to ₹54,190 crore by 2019-20.But this otherwise exciting story of textbook publishing in India has taken a grim turn with sales of many well-known publishers dropping as much as 50% compared to last year.“Publishers are sitting on massive unsold stocks. Since the Coronavirus lockdown happened in March, the last-mile sales of books suffered. Most publishers had dispatched the books to distributors or bookshops but a lot of stocks are still lying unsold with them. Nearly 30-40% stocks may come back as returns,” said Monica Malhotra Kandhari, vice president, Federation of Indian Publishers and managing director, MBD Group, one of India’s oldest and largest publishing companies.“Our sales have plummeted 50% this academic session,” says Ashwani Goyal, managing director, Goyal Publishers, one of the country’s largest publishers of language learning books.Many in the industry say that one of the major reasons for the fall in the textbook sales is also the fact that a large number of children of migrant workers in budget schools have gone back to their villages, and are unable to continue their education online. The point is endorsed by the owners of the budget schools.“Our schools had 400 children, most of them belonging to low-income migrant families, and we have lost touch with 50% of them. We have been able to provide online education to only about 30 children. Our fee is only Rs 700 for Class 8 and Rs 400 for nursery, still only 21 out of 400 children paid fees last month. Their families are struggling for survival; education and books do not seem to be their priority, ” says DP Sharma, who runs Ved Pal Memorial School in Hastal in Uttam Nagar, west Delhi, which has 150 budget schools, most of which came up in the past two decades; most complain of thousands of “missing” students.Bharat Arora, general secretary, Action Committee of Unaided Recognized Private Schools, an association of private schools in Delhi, says that this year many private schools also recommended digital books.“A lot of private schools put the list of books on websites recommended and digital books in case the children were unable to buy physical copies. Besides, schools were also sending chapters of various books online in April . There has never been such online consumption of education content before, ” Arora says.Ashwani Goyal said what has also affected sales is online piracy “ I am surprised by the number of illegal PDFs of our printed books available online,” says Goyal, who has about 800 titles in circulation, catering to school and college students. In the past few months, he has digitized most of his titles and made them available on e-reading platforms such as Bru.Like many other publishers, Goyal feels that recycling of old books during the lockdown in April and May also affected sales. Aparajitha Gautam, president, Delhi Parents Association, says that between March and May, the association aggressively promoted the exchange of old books across the city through thousands of parents’ WhatsApp groups. “This helped children procure books when all bookshops were closed and even-e-commerce companies were not delivering books. Eventually, a large number of parents did not buy new books at all, and many bought only a few select books apart from notebooks,” she says.Ish Kapur, who runs Dhanpat Rai Publications, says sales of books have been affected differently in different parts of the country. “ Textbooks sales are particularly dismal in Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu , which are severely hit by the Coronavirus pandemic. The sales of books for primary classes have been particularly bad,” says Kapur, whose publication house is known for its mathematics books by RD Sharma. “Our sales are down by 25%; we have never seen such a downturn in business in our 70-year-old history. The sales of even our best -selling titles have been affected,” adds Kapur.The textbook industry follows a sales and marketing strategy that is completely different from that of trade publishers because it is aligned with the school academic year.Every year, in October, representatives and salespersons of various publishing companies start visiting schools across the country for meeting principals and teachers, to make presentations on their books.“We touched base with 70,000 schools last year. However, we are not sure if we will be able to undertake the same exercise this year as the schools are still closed. The production of books starts in August-September each year; but this year as the publishers are sitting with stocks, it seems only 10-20% production may happen,” says Kandhari.Talking of the future of print textbooks in the post-Covid world, she says textbook publishers will have to reinvent themselves. “Hybrid model of education with a mix of online and in-person classes is going to be the new normal. The textbooks will co-exist with digital learning content,” says Kandhari.
Updated: Sep 13, 2020 09:07 ISTAfter making arrangements for smooth conduct of the NEET examination, the Odisha government on Saturday made it clear that the candidates having high temperature and certain symptoms of COVID, but not tested positive, will be allowed to take the test.This was decided at a review meeting here attended by District Magistrate of Khurda of which Bhubaneswar is a part, senior health department officials and NEET state nodal officer Polly Patnaik.“Yes, the candidates having more than normal body temperature and symptoms of COVID, but not tested positive, will be allowed to appear the examination,” Khurda DM S K Mohanty told PTI after the meeting.The District Magistrate also made it clear that as per the guideline, the students who have tested positive for the infection will be given the opportunity to appear in the NEET examination on a later date, through a digital platform.Asked how to deal with the candidates having COVID symptoms, Mohanty said: “Those students will be isolated and be provided seats in separate rooms. Maximum 12 students will be allotted a seat in a room keeping in view the physical distancing.” The DM said the invigilators attending the students having symptoms of COVID-19 will wear PPEs while performing examination duty.Wearing face masks and using sanitizers is mandatory for each candidate. The medical teams have been deployed in the hostels in five engineering colleges where the candidates are staying.This apart, the DM said local transport like auto- rickshaws and taxis have been put in place to bring the students to the examination centres.All arrangements have been made for the NEET examination on Sunday across 7 Cities in 7 districts as per the guidelines of National Testing Agency (NTA) by the respective Collectors and Municipal Commissioners, Additional Chief Secretary, Health and Family Welfare P K Mohapatra said, adding that the “students are advised to appear the examination without any fear of COVID-19.” The state government has made elaborate arrangements to facilitate free transportation and accommodation for candidates appearing for the NEET examination on Sunday in 83 centres across seven cities in the state, an official said.A total of 37,459 candidates will appear for the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test in Odisha.“The state government has made arrangements for free transportation and lodging facilities for candidates and their guardians,” the NEET state nodal officer said.State-run buses will be available to facilitate free movement of candidates and their guardians from different districts to the examination centres, she said.The examinations will be conducted from 11 am to 5 pm in strict adherence to health safety protocols to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease.Patnaik said candidates will have to undergo thermal screening before entering the centres in Bhubaneswar, Cuttack, Angul, Berhampur, Rourkela, Balasore and Sambalpur.The East Coast Railway will also run special trains for NEET aspirants, an official said.“The trains will run from Khariar Road to Sambalpur via Titlagarh, Rayagada to Sambalpur, Bhadrak to Bhubaneswar via Cuttack and Keonjhar to Bhubaneswar via Cuttack,” he said.The Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) has arranged accommodation for NEET candidates and their parents at five engineering colleges here.
Charles Dickens wrote A Tale of Two Cities but I’m less ambitious. I shall restrict myself to two warriors. They’re both in the news and they’re equally critical to our survival. Yet, on one we heap adulation. The other we take for granted.The first are our soldiers. We’ve placed them on a pedestal and look up to them as heroes. There’s nothing they can do wrong even when they actually have. Their faults are brushed under the carpet — ignored by the media and rarely discussed by the rest of us. When they err, we’re only too ready to forgive. We see them as valorous, unselfish, patriotic and better.We use the term martyrs when they die without realising how incorrect it is. Forget its religious overtones, what’s more inappropriate is martyrs want to die. They embrace death. Soldiers definitely do not. They want to live. They have wives and children, mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers waiting for them. It’s this world they want to be a part of, not that of the angels and spirits.The other set of warriors are doctors, nurses and health care workers. No doubt we’ve coined the term Covid warriors to refer to them, but it’s used very differently. We don’t see them as heroes, we don’t look up to them and rarely do we praise them. We only remember them when we’re sick. The rest of the time, they fade into the background.Yet, at the moment, it’s our doctors and nurses who’ve put themselves in the line of fire to keep the rest of us safe and alive. Unless there’s a war, they face greater danger than any soldier in uniform. Every time they tend to a patient, they risk infection. Reports suggest 87,000 health care workers have been infected and 573 have died.There’s one further point that probably doesn’t occur to most of us. I’m grateful to Dr Saleem Naik for drawing my attention to it. When a soldier fights a war, it’s his own life that’s at risk. When doctors, nurses and health care staff assist Covid-19 patients, they risk bringing the infection home to their parents, wives and children. As Dr Naik puts it: “The enemy’s bullet doesn’t enter the soldier’s household.” On the other hand, the threat of infection from Covid isn’t restricted to hospitals.I know some state governments have announced lump sums when doctors and nurses die. However, the amount pales in comparison to what a dead soldier’s family can receive. His casket will return draped in the tricolour, his funeral is broadcast on television and a grateful nation will honour him with medals and citations. In due course, Bollywood will romanticise his memory.Nothing of the sort happens when a doctor or a nurse falls victim to Covid-19. There are no 21-gun salutes, no politicians to praise their work, no television anchors to sing the chorus.Now consider how society’s attitude makes the difference feel worse. Foolish gated communities and thoughtless resident’s welfare associations have tried to shut their doors on doctors and nurses for fear their presence could spread Covid-19. We stigmatise them, at times treat them like untouchables.Even when we chose to honour them, we did so more by farce than meaningfully. Army bands played outside hospitals whilst air force planes scattered rose petals. This may have been spectacle, but it lacked substance. To me, it seemed devoid of sincerity.If we really mean what we say when we call them warriors, let the Army line up when they die and let our ministers be present at their funerals. Let television tell their sad stories with the same tireless dedication with which it speaks of soldiers killed in action.As an Army officer’s son, I want to frankly say I despair of a society that values its soldiers more than its doctors and nurses. Perhaps that’s because of our insecurity. In that case, it could be understandable.But if it reflects our values, it’s more than inexplicable. It feels wrong.Karan Thapar is the author of Devil’s Advocate: The Untold StoryThe views expressed are personal
The Boris Johnson government is considering imposing another nationwide lockdown after the UK reported a fresh surge of Covid-19 cases - 4,322 coronavirus infections were recorded on Friday - with experts and ministers huddled in meetings over the weekend amid growing ire over steps taken to stop the spread of the virus.Johnson admitted major challenges in providing tests and saw a second wave coming after similar spikes in cases were reported in other European countries as well. Experts want more stringent measures in place sooner than later.Epidemiologist Neil Ferguson, whose modelling had influenced the decision to impose the first lockdown earlier this year, said on Saturday the UK is now facing a “perfect storm” due to the easing of some of the curbs in recent months, and called for quick action.Day-rise figures have been in the thousands in September after similar figures in the hundreds in July and August. There are local restrictions in north England and the Midlands, where the increase in infections is alarmingly prominent. From Monday, gatherings on more than six people have been banned.Also Read: UK to launch new Covid curbs, not ruling out national lockdownSpeaking during a visit to Oxfordshire, Prime Minister Johnson said, “We are now seeing a second wave coming in. We’ve seen it in France, in Spain, across Europe. It’s been absolutely inevitable, I’m afraid, that we would see it in this country.“We want to keep the schools open - that’s going to happen. And we’ll try and keep all parts of the economy open, as far as we possibly can. I don’t think anybody wants to go into a second lockdown.”The UK PM said, “Clearly, when you look at what is happening, you’ve got to wonder whether we need to go further than the rule of six that we brought in on Monday. We’ll be looking at the local lockdowns we’ve got in large parts of the country now and see what we can do to intensify things.”New measures that could mean another lockdown are due to be announced on Monday or Tuesday, after the opposition Labour joined experts to call for swift action to stop the spread of coronavirus.Labour leader Keir Starmer said, “I am deeply concerned about the sharp rise in coronavirus cases and the difficulties people across the country are facing in getting a test… This is the time for swift, decisive national action. We cannot afford to be too slow.”
In July 2017, 28 state governments agreed to give up their sovereign right to levy taxes to make way for the Goods and Services Tax (GST). They agreed to do so because the central government put in an insurance clause, guaranteeing a 14% annual increase in their revenues up to 2022. Meeting this commitment has become increasingly challenging. In a GST Council meeting held on Thursday, the Centre has asked the states to borrow money to meet an (expected) shortfall of Rs 2.35 lakh crore in the promised compensation this year. Of this, it has estimated Rs 97,000 crore as arising from GST implementation — a narrow technical definition that gives it a possible way out of paying the remaining Rs 1.38 lakh crore , which it attributes to Covid-19.The Centre will approach the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to facilitate this process and the repayments will done by extending the duration of cess on luxury and sin goods. But finance ministers of many Opposition-ruled states have objected, arguing that it is the Centre which should have borrowed the money rather than states. These objections are valid when read with the spirit of the GST law. The final decision will be taken next week, when the Council meets again. The states are already in a tight spot. Pending arrears for GST compensation payment to states from April-July 2020 stand at Rs 1.5 lakh crore. While the Centre has claimed that the revenue situation will improve over rest of the year and the total shortfall this year will be contained to Rs 2.35 lakh crore, there is no guarantee on this count. Many private projections estimate that the economy will remain in contraction zone until December.GST is not the only revenue head under strain. The states will also have to contend with a big shortfall in their own revenues and lower transfers from the Centre for direct taxes and other indirect taxes. A growing share of non-divisible pool of central taxes, such as the windfall tax gains from fall in crude oil prices, will mean that the states bear a greater burden of the revenue shortfall due to the pandemic. The states are doing most of the heavy lifting in fighting the health and economic consequences of the pandemic. The uncertainty on GST compensation payments, along with a huge shortfall in states’ share in other central taxes, means that India’s fiscal federalism is facing its biggest crisis in a long time.

Updated: Sep 19, 2020 23:04 ISTThe Drug Controller General of India (DGCI) on Saturday approved country’s first Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic (CRISPR) Covid-19 test for commercial launch. This is developed by Tata and powered by CSIR-IGIB (Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology) FELUDA (an acronym for FNCAS9 Editor-Limited Uniform Detection Assay).“The approval for the Tata CRISPR test for COVID-19 will give a boost to the country’s efforts in fighting the global pandemic. The commercialization of the Tata CRISPR test reflects the tremendous R&D talent in the country, which can collaborate to transform India’s contributions to the global healthcare and scientific research world,” Girish Krishnamurthy, CEO, TATA Medical and Diagnostics Ltd, said.Also Read | Covid-19 vaccine: Serum Institute to start final phase of trial next weekWhat is Tata CRISPR test?*CRISPR is a genome editing technology to diagnosing diseases.*Tata CRISPR Covid-19 test uses an indigenously developed, cutting-edge CRISPR technology for detection of the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 virus.*This is the world’s first diagnostic test to deploy a specially adapted Cas9 protein to successfully detect the virus causing Covid-19.*The Tata CRISPR test achieves accuracy levels of traditional RT-PCR tests.* However, it will take lesser time to process the results.

The Lok Sabha on Wednesday took up for consideration a bill to address the potential disruptions in the financial system by providing for the Reserve Bank of India to prepare a scheme for reconstruction or amalgamation of the banking company without the necessity of first making an order of moratorium.Moving the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Bill 2020 for passage of the House, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the legislation had been brought to protect the interest of depositors.The bill will replace an ordinance brought earlier by the government.“For the last two years, depositors of cooperative banks and small banks are facing problems. We are trying to bring this amendment in order to protect the depositors. Because these banks have fallen into hard days requiring therefore the regulator to bring a moratorium and to solve the problem seems to consume all the time. During the budget session in March, we introduced this bill in order to have the amendments brought in so that depositors’ interest will be taken care of. But unfortunately, during the budget session, we could not have this bill passed,” Sitharaman said.She said the government had to go for an ordinance because the financial health of many of the cooperative societies, which are also performing as banks, “was becoming very delicate”.“The financial state of affairs of 277 urban cooperative banks is weak and they are reporting loss. 105 cooperative banks are unable to meet the minimum regulatory capital requirement. 47 banks have net worth is negative. 328 urban cooperative banks have more than 15 per cent gross NPA ratio,” she said.The minister said that in March 2020, the stress in cooperative banks increased due to pandemic and gross ratios of urban cooperative banks increased from 7.7 per cent in March 2019 to over 10 per cent in March 2020. “Therefore, it was felt that the ordinance should be brought in the interest of depositors.”She said the bill will not apply to a primary agricultural credit society or a co-operative society whose primary object and principal business is providing of long term finance for agricultural development if such society does not use as part of its name, or in connection with its business, the words “bank”, “banker” or “banking” and does not act as drawee of cheques.The amendments entail making provisions applicable on cooperative banks which apply on commercial banks so that the former is equally subjected to better governance and sound banking regulations through the RBI.The minister said “amendments to section 45 will enable the RBI to make a scheme of reconstruction and amalgamation, for example, the way in which Yes Bank reconstruction happened to protect the interest of depositors”.Participating in the debate, Congress leader Manish Tewari opposed the manner in which the government had brought an ordinance.
Actor Ananya Panday shared a picture and a video from the shoot of Khaali Peeli. One of them was rather funny, which showed her balancing a coconut on her head ask co-star Ishaan Khatter took a picture.Sharing them, she wrote: ““Describe your experience working with Ishaan Khatter” .... #cocoNUTS #KhaaliPeeli #2ndOctober on @zeeplexofficial @macriaan.” The picture shows a coconut placed precariously on Ananya’s head as she tries hard to contain her laugh. Ishaan, with a smirk on his face, is seen clicking the picture.In a video, Ananya can be seen telling Ishaan to take care. She then expresses her concern that it is about to fall, as a person, presumably Ishaan, records it. After a few seconds, the coconut falls off her head as she declares, “The badams also fell.”A song from their film, Beyonse Sharma jayegi (previously spelt as Beyonce) ran into rough weather when it released. Twitter called it racist for the use of the word ‘goriya (fair in Hindi)’. Reacting to the furore, he told Film Companion in an interview, “The word ‘gori’ has been taken out of context, as I understand it. I have asked a lot of questions to people from rural areas, who’ve clarified that ‘gori’ has been used in multiple songs, for ages, as just referencing a girl. Like you’d say ‘launda’ or ‘chhora’, you also say ‘gori’, and that is the context in which it was used.”He continued, “It was never meant to be about the complexion, let alone race. As for Beyonce, for this ‘tapori’ character, his biggest reference for somebody beautiful, and stylish and iconic is Beyonce. If anything, it’s flattering. That’s why he goes so far as even to compare this girl he’s trying to woo to Beyonce, because he’s trying to flatter her.”Besides Ishaan and Ananya, the film stars Jaideep Ahlawat and Zakir Hussain in pivotal roles. Khaali Peeli will release on October 2, 2020, on Zee’s new platform - Zee Plex.
Suspended by the country’s Olympic body for “maladministration”, Cricket South Africa (CSA) on Tuesday said it had a “positive meeting” with the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee as it looks to find a collaborative approach.CSA, which is in the middle of administrative chaos and facing allegations of corruption and racial discrimination, suffered a setback when last week SASCOC had asked it to “step aside” as it investigated “many instances of maladministration and malpractice” in the organisation.CSA said some some key points were identified during the meeting.“The meeting presented a step forward towards a collaborative approach in the interest of good governance and executive operations,” CSA said in a statement on Tuesday.“Key points were identified and deliberated by the attendees, which included CSA’s Members’ Council and the Board of Directors of SASCOC, with the ultimate end goal of achieving a unified focus on the game of cricket,” it added.The two bodies “agreed that further details of the key points will be discussed during a joint press conference on Thursday, 17 September 2020.”Following SASCOC’s action, there is no one to run daily affairs of CSA and it now runs the risk of facing action from the International Cricket Council (ICC) if it sees it as government interference.CSA’ former CEO Thabang Monroe was fired last month following the findings of a forensic report that revealed “acts of serious misconduct”, while Acting CEO Jacques Faul and president Chris Nenzani resigned last month with Kugandrie Govender replacing Faul.The Country’s elite players have also criticised CSA for postponing its AGM scheduled for September 5.

The Trump administration’s move to curtail H-1B visas widely used by foreign technology workers in the US survived an initial court challenge.President Donald Trump’s June 22 proclamation declaring foreign workers a risk to the US labor market amid the coronavirus pandemic triggered pushback from workers and business groups. An array of the nation’s biggest tech companies have warned that the policy will do “irreparable harm on businesses and the nation’s economy.”But in a ruling Wednesday, US District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington declined to bar the administration from imposing the visa restrictions while the legal challenge to them plays out.The case was brought by a group of 169 Indian nationals who recently went back to India after living in the US on work visas and are now attempting to return. They argued that the proclamation was “arbitrary and capricious” and called for the government to process their visa applications.Lawyers for the plaintiffs didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But they said in a court filing that they will appeal.The president’s visa order freezes through the end of the year new H-1B and H-4 visas, widely used by technology workers and their families, as well as L visas for intracompany transfers and most J visas for work- and study-abroad programs.The ruling on Wednesday was the second time this month that Mehta has denied a request to suspend the proclamation. Just as he did in a Sept. 4 ruling in a related case involving a group of visa applicants, Mehta found that the Indian workers fell short of the high legal threshold for an order blocking the decree while the litigation proceeds.In both cases, the judge concluded the plaintiffs were not likely to succeed in showing that Trump exceeded his authority with the proclamation.A different federal judge in Oakland, California, is weighing another request to block the decree from business groups including the US Chamber of Commerce.
If Indians could vote in the United States (US) presidential elections, they will probably go with the incumbent, if he (or she and they, someday) was on the ballot for a second term, no matter how poorly the candidate was polling at home.Indians — not to be confused with Indian-Americans — appear to like American presidents once they get to know them, which can be after a visit or an agreement or just personal charm. That should explain, to an extent, President Donald Trump’s loud and insistent Indian supporters. I have got to know some of them from their angry mails or messages in response to something disagreeable I wrote about the US president.President Barack Obama finished his sixth year in office in January 2015 with an average approval rating of 42.6%, according to Gallup, which has tracked US presidents for decades. This was the lowest of the yearly averages of his eight years in office. Six months later in June, as his domestic ratings hovered around 45%, a Pew global poll found 74% of Indians approved of Obama and had confidence he would do the right thing in world affairs. Obama’s India visit in January may have played a role but, not entirely.President George W Bush found his mark with Indians before his own India visit. A 2005 global poll by Pew, such as the one cited above, found 54% Indians approved of Bush and had confidence he would do the right thing in international affairs. By the time he left office in 2008, he had improved his India ratings to 55%, with an India visit in 2006 and the path-breaking India-US nuclear deal in 2008 in between. At home, only 33% Americans said they had confidence in his conduct of foreign relations in the same Pew poll, and clocked up about the same in domestic ratings at 34% in the Gallup tracker.President Trump had an indifferent start with Indians. He barely scraped by with the confidence of 14% of Indians as a candidate in 2016, in a Pew poll. By 2019, however, 56% of Indians had grown to have faith in his ability to do the right thing on the global stage.As the number of those sceptical of him remained stable in the poll, he appeared to have made inroads into 67% of respondents who had either refused to answer or had said they did not know him enough in 2016. His Gallup ratings at home, by contrast, have languished in the 40s.There are very good individually unique reasons of policies, pacts and personality behind the popularity of incumbents with Indians. But collectively, they appear to represent a pattern: you don’t have to try very hard to get the Indians on your side.But Indians in the US, an estimated 1.8 million Indian-Americans who are eligible to vote, are a completely different story. Many of them, who do not share the enthusiasm of their Indian relatives and friends for the US president, often find themselves yelling at their WhatsApp groups on their smartphones, and tapping out angry rejoinders in all-caps, much like the US president, Covefefe and all.yashwant.raj@hindustantimes.comThe views expressed are personal
Leaders of the two main opposition parties in Canada have gone into self-isolation less than a week before parliament reconvenes as the country witnessed a marked resurgence in coronavirus cases that may signal the possible arrival of a second wave of the deadly respiratory disease.Canada recorded 1,037 new Covid-19 cases on Friday, an increase of 58% compared to the situation two weeks earlier. According to the US-based Johns Hopkins University coronavirus tally, the total number of Covid-19 cases in Canada has surpassed 144,000, while the disease has claimed at least 9,250 lives.Erin O’Toole, leader of Canada’s principal opposition Conservative Party, has gone into self-isolation along with family members after a member his staff tested positive for Covid-19.Also in quarantine was Yves-François Blanchet, leader of the Bloc Québécois, the second largest opposition group in the House of Commons, after he tested positive along with his wife. Several MPs from his party have gone into self-isolation as a precautionary measure.The Canadian parliament is scheduled to meet on September 23. The upcoming sitting is set to feature a Throne Speech from the country’s governor general that is expected to outline an ambitious agenda for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government.Trudeau has already sought virtual voting in the House so that legislative business can continue even as many MPs are unable to attend sessions in Ottawa in person.As cases surged, Tina Namiesniowski, the president of the Public Health Agency of Canada, has announced her resignation even as authorities responsible for dealing with the pandemic have increasingly come under criticism for their failure to control the spread of the disease.While not yet declaring a second wave, Theresa Tam, Canada’s chief public health officer, has warned that the “ongoing increase in the national daily case count is an indicator of accelerated epidemic growth”.She said in a statement, “This situation increases the likelihood that we could lose the ability to keep Covid-19 cases at manageable levels.”Several provinces have been reporting a spike in cases, including Ontario, where over 400 new infections - the highest since June - have been recorded after the daily case count had dropped to under 100 last month.British Columbia reported an all-time high of 179 Covid-19 cases on Friday, forcing the authorities to bring back some of the restrictions in Toronto, including limiting indoor gatherings to 10 and outdoor gatherings to 25.
He may have retired from competitive cricket long ago, but even at the age of 51, Jonty Rhodes still has it. Rhodes, considered by many as the greatest fielder of all time, made a career out of taking stunners, sublime catches that no mortal man would be able to take back in the day.Also Follow | IPL 2020 Full CoverageIt was during the 1992 World Cup, that a flying Jonty Rhodes would run Inzamam-Ul-Haq with an effort unbelievable to the eyes, and continued setting benchmarks in fielding up until his retirement after the 2003 World Cup.Also Read | ‘Virat Kohli leads from the front, sets an example’: AB de Villiers lauds RCB skipper ahead of IPL 2020Despite being done as a cricketer, Rhodes has been involved with several franchises, mostly as its fielding coach. He was with the Mumbai Indians for several years before jumping ships this year to Kings XI Punjab. As the players went about their training, Rhodes led several fielding sessions, but the tables turned when the former batsman himself tried at catching a few, and as expected, it was as if he never stopped fielding.Also Read | ‘Just watching them bat is very exciting:’ Australia’s Adam Zampa eager to work with Virat Kohli, AB de VilliersIn a video posted by KXIP on their Twitter handle, Rhodes is seen taking a couple of wonderful catches. He dives to his left and uses both his hands to grab what looked like a toughie. However, the next one was a jaw-dropping effort. As the thrower instructed, Rhodes went full stretched to his right and plucked the ball out of thin air. The effort called for a ‘You still got it’ chant.On September 10, it was confirmed that Rhodes will be moving to Sweden with his family after the IPL to take charge as head coach of the country’s national team. Rhodes said he is excited about the fresh challenge he will face in a country not known for its cricket. The federation feels that the association with Rhodes will not only help its national team but also the grassroots.

A Chinese woman and a Nepalese man have been arrested by the Delhi Police for their alleged involvement in the spy ring involving Delhi-based journalist Rajeev Sharma, who is already in police custody for allegedly passing on classified information to China, officials said on Saturday.Sharma, a resident of Pitampura, was arrested for spying for China on September 14, police had said.Police have registered a case under the Official Secrets Act (OSA) against Sharma, and the Chinese and Nepalese nationals have been arrested under the same charges, deputy commissioner of police (special cell) Sanjeev Kumar Yadav said.“A freelance journalist, Rajeev Sharma, a resident of Pitampura New Delhi, has been arrested by the Special Cell in an Official Secrets Act case.

Shubh Kumar, a student of Radiant International School in Patna, has emerged the Bihar topper in the JEE main exam, the results for which were declared on Friday. He got 99.997 percentile, and missed the list of 24 candidates, who got 100 NTA score, by a whisker.What is credit worthy for Subham, is that he cracked JEE-Mains in his first attempt. In the CBSE +2 exam this year, he had scored 98%.“It all boils down to balanced and consistent study. I studied for up to 12 hours a day, as I had to take care of both Plus Two as well as JEE. The good thing is that JEE preparations cover almost 90% of the board syllabus,” said Subham from his home in Patna.Son of a JD-U leader and businessman Sushil Kumar Suman and Reena Kumari, housewife, he is now focusing on JEE-Advance. “I want to get into IIT-Mumbai or IIT-Delhi and pursue computer science. I want to do research in computer science,” said Subham.Subham said that he did a two-year programme from Vidya Mandir Classes after clearing his class 10 board from the same school and he managed both. Shubh had scored 97% in Class 10. He says that he has been completely off social media to stay focused.“I restricted myself to studies. Self-study helps a lot. Even in school, we enjoyed a lot of freedom. One needs to revise what one studies in the classroom and there is no shortcut. I did a lot of mock tests. I don’t have a habit of moving around. But now during lockdown I have started playing table tennis a bit,” he said.A happy Subham’s father, who earlier held the post of secretary in the JD-U, said that right from the beginning, Subham was focused to his studies, even as he remained busy with his work. “In Class 8, he had also gone to the USA from school after getting selected for a programme. I really feel proud and thankful to God for blessings,” he added.

In his long career with Delhi, India and in the Indian Premier League (IPL), two things have been constant for Shikhar Dhawan—aggression as a batsman and a calmness that borders on the monkish away from the playing field.No wonder then that when we suggest the IPL bio-bubble, where players will spend more than two months cut off from the rest of the world is akin to a retreat, Dhawan smiles and agrees.“Nice to test our mental strength,” he says, speaking via a Zoom call from his hotel room in the UAE.Then, ominously, he adds: “It’s almost like Big Boss.”IPL 2020 Full CoverageThe IPL, which begins September 19 in the UAE, will see players holed up for roughly 80 days, their worlds circumscribed by their hotel, training ground, and match venue, where they will play to empty stadiums. That’s a lot to contend with.“It (the bio-bubble) is a new thing for everyone,” he says. “More than challenging, I see it as an opportunity to improve in every aspect. I keep myself entertained; I take it in a positive way.”Success at this season’s tournament, Dhawan says, could depend on how players navigate this new reality.“It totally depends on how a person talks to himself; you can be your best friend or you can be a victim,” Dhawan says. “You can have 10 people who are positive around you, but if you are not your friend, no one can help.“We don’t have any outlet. I enjoy going to a restaurant, seeing people. So, how are people going to take it? This IPL it’s going to matter a lot.“If people are not performing well, how do they take it? They have to stay with the same people, in the hotel only, in the same space. I am sure it’s going to have a huge impact on everyone.”Dhawan himself is well-equipped to handle this mental challenge; during the months of lockdown, he delved into meditation and yoga, practices that he says has helped him both physically and mentally.“My stamina, focus, and mobility has got better,” he says, “I used to have a stiff body, my mobility has really gone to a level I like. Also skills keep changing. Little things that you won’t notice, like my stance has changed a little. Some of it is detailed stuff that of course I won’t like to tell.”All of those things will be put to the test when the 34-year-old opener plays his first competitive game of cricket since January, when the Delhi Capitals will begin their campaign vs Kings XI Punjab on Sunday.In this new and unusual setting, the challenge for Delhi Capitals remains the same--an IPL win has remained elusive in 12 seasons, and no team has finished at the bottom as many times as Delhi has. Yet, last season, a homecoming for Dhawan after the batsman spent four successful years at Sunrisers Hyderabad (he won the league in 2016), Delhi Capitals reached the play-offs. Dhawan scored 521 runs, the fourth highest of the season.“More than skill-based, it’s going to be mentally challenging, coming after five months and playing in such a big tournament. It will take a lot of courage, skill and everything for a team to start doing well. Can there be a new winner? Why not? Someone was saying how every leap year there is a new winner. Hopefully, we will see Delhi Capitals lifting the trophy.”Dhawan and his new Delhi teammate R Ashwin have won the IPL with Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings respectively and the two will look to shepherd the younger talent in the side.“Prithvi (Shaw) is in good touch, he is a class player. And Rishabh, Shreyas and Prithvi all are maturing as well. And we have Ajinkya Rahane, Ashwin coming in… I feel we’ve got a very complete side. Especially at the start, the pitches are going to be nice, I am assuming. Playing only on three venues, we will get turning pitches as well. We got enough batsmen who play the turning ball well. We have Marcus Stoinis and Alex Carey, Shimron Hetmyer and Keemo Paul as well, and Lalit Yadav is a good bat and bowls off-spin.”The big talking point are the low and slow pitches that are likely to be on offer at the three UAE venues and how teams will cope in those conditions. The practice pitches though have been bouncy “like we were in Perth”, says Dhawan. “After some time the pitches can get slow and low, but we have all bases covered. Aap order karo, wohi aap ke samne pesh karte hain! (you order and we will deliver).”For Dhawan, the priority is straightforward--give his team an explosive start.“In IPL, we have to give a fiery start,” he says. “And then the person who is set takes the game further. I would love to be an impact player, create momentum for my team. For 5-6 overs mostly I am the aggressor for India too; Rohit (Sharma) takes his time and then plays. I am talking about ODIs here. (In T20) you get 6-7 balls to settle. Sometimes it depends on what the team role is, if the team wants 50 runs from 6 overs...everyday it’s not the same thing, but mostly you have to fire from both ends and that’s the best thing. And at the same time be smart enough not to lose too many wickets.”Despite the breakneck pace and big-hitting nature of the game, T20s, like any other format of cricket, requires a certain kind of patience, says Dhawan.“When you’re desperate, you are running after it, it’s difficult to do well,” he says. “It happened with me. I was playing against New Zealand (2016), I knew if I didn’t play well, I would be out. I was working hard but was desperate and eventually I was dropped. I realized desperate energy is not nice. When you are relaxed, you are happier. For me happiness and calmness are what matters.“If you are desperate, you will not have clarity and will be rushing for solutions. Under pressure, great players know how to play. Dhoni bhai used to take the game till the last over, not many can do that. He was never desperate, or rushing it. That is why he could pull the game away from the other team.”Among IPL teams this season, Capitals have arguably the most high-profile coach in Ricky Ponting. The Aussie legend’s advice for Dhawan is simple. “He is a great coach and I enjoy working with him. He told me, keep your body language stronger and I worked on it and it has helped me. We (players) are mindful of the need to do specific things so that we improve.”What is Dhawan’s own advice to teammates? “I always tell them to keep the process right. We repeat the success mantra often, once we keep doing that, everything will keep coming to us. We shouldn’t be getting desperate to go after something because we haven’t won it.”

Updated: Sep 15, 2020 15:09 ISTMany believe that what started as a cry for a fair trial and finding the truth behind the sad passing of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, has now just become a scathing attack on each other in Bollywood. Actor Shriya Pilgoankar wants to keep an arms distance from all this chatter and advocates others to do the same.“I don’t watch the news. As people we have a responsibility towards how we consume our news, especially when the case is so sensitive and close to everybody’s heart. The least we can do is be respectful about it. The sad part is that everybody is coming with their own agenda right now. What all of us somewhere everybody wants right now is for the right authorities to do their job,” explains the actor.Pilgaonkar also feels that everyone is peddling their version of the story and spreading different narratives.“But then there is the truth and then there is everyone’s version. So I am just somebody that does not participate in conversations which are on baseless information. Now we have the authorities handling the matter, they need to be given a chance to do the investigation in a fair manner,” adds the Mirzapur actor.She also laments the hatred that is being spread by a section about the film industry. “The hatred that is spewing, the wrong information that is being peddled… I don’t know how it is going to lead to anything,” she wonders.Pilgaonkar also feels that in the lockdown, people have seen extreme human behavior, the best and the worst. ““At t a time when we need to operate from a place of empathy and kindness towards each other, people are choosing a convenient route behind their screen to just spew hatred without even understanding what the situation is. I feel very helpless right now. You just don’t know what to do when you see people believing in anything and everything they hear without actual evidence and investigation. I don’t indulge myself in that. It is difficult for me to not get mentally depressed about it,” she concludes.
With JEE Advanced Exam 2020, scheduled, just three weeks away on 27th September 2020, aspirants are already on their toes, preparing to clear the final hurdle in their path to secure the most prestigious seat in the IIT’s. Even though it is one of the toughest entrance exams to clear, proper preparation strategies, rigorous practice will help students clear the exams with ease. As the stress levels and pressure will be on the higher side among the students, yet their focus should be to effectively utilize the remaining one-week properly. The students should prepare with a full proof time table devoting equal time slots for each subject along with at least 10 tests with quick Test Analysis and guidance from subject experts.JEE Advanced paper has a mixture of various types of questions. There are questions of multiple choice type with either single correct answer or multiple correct answers. There could be comprehensions followed by two or more objective type questions with single or multiple correct answers. The matrix match type questions may involve matching two columns or even three columns. The Integer type questions involve a subjective type question with the answer an integer or could be asked correct to two decimal places. Students are advised to be careful as the paper has negative marking. The preparation strategy should be built with effective time management and subject-wise planning.Here are some vital tips that will help you to prepare for JEE Advanced in the last 3 weeks.Study Schedule: With just a week left, the students must follow the time table strictly. Getting success in JEE Advanced is not that easy but do remember with hard work and commitment you can achieve anything in life.Mock tests: Play an important role in making you familiar with the pattern of paper as well as checks your strong and weaker areas. To analyze your preparation and build the right examination temperament, students are advised to take mock tests. It is advisable to do Test Analysis after every Mock Test for improvement. Take at least two to three mocks Tests per week in the last One month on actual timings of JEE Advanced. You may refer to previous year papers or Test Series from reputed sources like MyPAT.Time Management: Always remembers all students have 24 hours a day. Most of the students have queries about how many hours of studies can change the outcome? As per the experts, at least 5-6 hours of serious study in a day is vital to crack JEE Advanced.Speed and Accuracy: There would be limited time given to the students to complete the exam. You have to maintain a constant speed but don’t forget accuracy will help you gain more marks. There is negative marking in the exam. The accuracy will come with practicing the questions in limited time.Health: Don’t forget to take care of your physical and mental well being. In the end, good health is very important for any exam. Take a good sleep for about 6 hours a day. This should be done a month before the exam. Keep your immunity strong as this will protect you from falling ill before the exam.The pattern for the exam remains constant, however, no question has ever been repeated in JEE Advanced exam. As the question paper for the JEE Advanced exam will be divided into three sections Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics.The major focus should be given to the following topics:Mathematics: Quadratic Equations & Expressions, Complex Numbers, Probability, Vectors & 3D Geometry, Matrices in Algebra; Circle, Parabola, Hyperbola in Coordinate Geometry; Functions, Limits, Continuity and Differentiability, Application of Derivatives, Definite Integral in Calculus.Physics: Mechanics, Fluids, Heat & Thermodynamics, Waves and Sound, Capacitors & Electrostatics, Magnetics, Electromagnetic Induction, Optics, and Modern Physics.Chemistry: Qualitative Analysis, Coordination Chemistry & Chemical Bonding in Inorganic Chemistry, Electrochemistry, Thermodynamics, Chemical Equilibrium in Physical Chemistry and Organic Chemistry Complete as a topic.Strategy for attempting various pattern of questions:Multiple Choice Questions with Single Choice Correct: The best way to attempt these questions is to run through the Question- Option – Question way. Scanning the question again after the options in mind helps to strategize the approach to solve the question. Sometimes the options themselves guide the correct strategy or even the correct answer.Multiple Choice Questions with Multiple Choice Correct: Each question has to be solved and mapped with all options. It may also happen that the options are the same values written in a different form. Statistically, these are the questions with the least percentage of correct responses.Comprehension Based: Even if you know the concept mentioned in Comprehension, you should still read it thoroughly, there are chances of redefining a concept or providing hypothetical assumptions. In that case your correct approach might lead to an incorrect answer.Matrix Match Type (One to One Matching): If the question is of One to One matching, then your approach should be finding the odd one out(if any). This will help you quickly reach the correct mapping.Matrix Match Type (One to Many Matching): This type of Matrix Match would be the most challenging and time taking. The suggested way would be to attempt this problem if you are confident on the concepts of all 4 rows, or else keep this question at bay for last.Numerical Based Answer Type: Generally these questions are the subjective questions converted to objective, and hence would be time taking. The correct way would be to treat them as subjective and solve them only if you have a command on the topic or if you have attempted all other questions of the paper. These questions also have a low scoring statistical record. Last year answers correct to two decimal places were also asked. So, students are advised to write answers correct to decimal places as asked.Reason Assertion Type: These days these types of questions are not at all asked, but in case there are few questions of this category, be very careful if both the statements are correct. Because then it’s very tricky to decide between the options A and B. or else you can mark the correct response easily.(The author Ramesh Batlish is an expert in FIITJEE, Noida.

An earthquake of magnitude 6.0 on the Richter scale jolted central Nepal on Wednesday morning. The epicentre of the tremor has been recorded at Ramche of Sindhupalchok district which has already been ravaged by flood and landslide and earthquake of 2015.“An earthquake of magnitude 6.0 occurred around Ramche of Sindhupalchok district at 5:19 am,” the National Seismological Centre tweeted minutes after the tremors.The tremors were felt in the most eastern part of the country as well. “It is a continued aftershock of 2015’s earthquake,” Chief Seismologist of NSC Lok Bijay Adhikari confirmed to ANI over the phone.No damages have been reported yet from the epicentre of the earthquake.“Since the jolt was felt, we haven’t received any reports of damage or loss of human lives. We have already contacted all the wards inside the district to confirm if any mishap occurred or anybody needs any assistance. As of now, we haven’t received any information on the matter,” Rajan Adhikari, Superintendent of Police stationed at Sindhupalchowk, confirmed to ANI in a telephonic conversation.In 2015, nearly 10,000 people had lost their lives and thousands were injured when an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.9 Richter scale had struck the Himalayan nation. Sindhupalchok, one of the epicentres of the earthquake, had suffered the most.
Updated: Sep 18, 2020 20:24 ISTHearing on the bail plea of Samuel Miranda, Dipesh Sawant and Bashit Parihar — all arrested in the drug case related to Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death — was adjourned by Bombay HC on Friday. The next hearing will be on September 29.Dipesh Sawant was Sushant’s personal assistant, Samuel Miranda is Rhea Chakraborty’s associate and Abdul Basit Parihar is an alleged drug peddler.A special court in Mumbai had last week rejected the bail plea of actor Rhea Chakraborty, her brother Showik, Dipesh Sawant, Samuel Miranda, Abdul Basit and Zaid Vilatra. However, Rhea and her brother have not moved a bail plea in the high court yet.The NCB had launched an investigation after it received official communication from the Enforcement Directorate (ED), in which there were various chats related to drug consumption, procurement, usage and transportation in connection with Sushant’s death.The Bollywood actor was found dead at his Mumbai residence on June 14. ED had registered an Enforcement Case Information Report in the late actor’s death case on July 31.
The Indian economy will contract by 9 per cent in 2020-21 as the coronavirus infections are yet to peak and the government is not providing adequate direct fiscal support, ratings agency Crisil said on Thursday.In May, Crisil had estimated the economy to contract by 5 per cent. The latest projection comes days after official data for the June quarter showed a contraction of 23.9 per cent in the economy.Crisil said the 9 per cent contraction will be the highest since the 1950s.The government had announced a Rs 20 lakh crore relief package but the actual new spending was less than 2 per cent of GDP.“With the pandemic’s peak not yet in sight and the government not providing adequate direct fiscal support, the downside risks to our earlier forecast have materialised,” the agency said.“A stretched fiscal position has constrained the government from spending more to support the economy. Till date, the policy push to growth remains muted, except in pockets. Our May forecast had assumed additional direct fiscal support of 1 per cent of GDP, which has not come through,” the agency said.It added that if the pandemic were to peak out in September-October, GDP growth could move into mild positive territory towards the end of this fiscal.India has overtaken Brazil as the second worst hit country with over 42 lakh coronavirus cases.Even as many analysts have been pitching for a sharp rebound or a v-shaped recovery, Crisil said the pandemic will leave a “permanent scar”.“We expect a permanent loss of 13 per cent of real GDP over the medium term,” it said, pegging its value in nominal terms at Rs 30 lakh crore and added that this is much higher than a 3 per cent permanent hit to GDP in Asia-Pacific economies estimated by its parent S&P.A “catch-up” with the pre-pandemic trend value of real GDP would require average real GDP growth to surge to 13 per cent annually for the next three fiscals, which is a feat never accomplished by India before, it said.It pegged the September quarter GDP to contract by 12 per cent, attributing the same to higher economic activity seen in many indicators.Its peer Icra on Thursday said it expects the second quarter GDP contraction to come at between 11-13 per cent and maintained its 9.5 per cent contraction for 2020-21.Crisil said agriculture will grow by 2.5 per cent in the current fiscal year and made it clear that the sector does not have the heft to offset the sharp contraction in other sectors of the economy which account for 85 per cent of the GDP.Consumption, the mainstay of growth for the last few years, will “sink” this year despite the help it will get from the rural areas, Crisil said, adding an investment recovery looks “distant” at present.It said the high inflation is also constraining the ability of the monetary policy to react to the growing concerns on growth.GDP growth will come at 10 per cent in 2021-22 on a lower base, but the agency said the medium term prospects for the economy are likely to trend down.“The truth with reforms is that you bite the bullet first and reap the benefits later. The government needs to take more steps to address the current pain in the economy. It should stretch itself fiscally to support vulnerable households and small business that have been hit hard by the pandemic,” the agency said.

Talking about her, he had earlier told HT Brunch, “You hear about Ash – we all did before I became an actor – she comes with this huge reputation of being some divaesque figure. Everyone imagines she floats on a cloud or something!. But anyone who knows her knows her to be genuine, down to earth, approachable and tactile. And that disarms you.

Faf du Plessis on Saturday stunned Hardik Pandya after picking a stunner in the deep during Mumbai Indian’s clash against Chennai Super Kings on the opening day of the 13th edition of Indian Premier League. The Proteas cricketer took two stunning catches back-to-back in the same over, but the one that got rid of Pandya was pure artistry.The moment took place in the 14th over when Ravindra Jadeja was bowling to Saurabh Tiwary and Hardik Pandya, who both were looking to go after the bowlers. In the first ball of the over, Tiwary went for a slog sweep on a length ball outside off stump, and the ball went straight to du Plessis at long-on.IPL 2020, MI vs CSK: Live score and updates🤭🤭🤭🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫 King du plessis second time pic.twitter.com/4mvpIyC88G — Ali_OO7_ (@Ali89430780) September 19, 2020The Proteas batsman lobbed the ball in the air as he was about to cross the boundary ropes, and then stepped out to take the ball comfortably, making it look easy.Four balls later, in the same over, Hardik Pandya smashed a delivery in the same area, and despite the ball being flat and towards Faf’s right at long-off, he sprinted and jumped up in the air to catch the ball before it goes over him for a six. Pandya looked stunned at the ‘Faf’-ulous catch by the fielder but had to walk back to the hut scoring just 14 runs.The two dismissals turned the tide of the match, as Mumbai Indians, who were looking to set a huge total on the board at one stage, could only muster 162/9 in 20 overs. Chennai Super Kings were asked to chase down 163 in the IPL 2020 opener.

Updated: Sep 16, 2020 14:28 ISTSome high frequency indicators are pointing towards stabilisation in economic activity in India but the recovery is still not entrenched and will only be gradual, Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das said on Wednesday.The major economy hardest by the coronavirus pandemic, India has been forecast by most leading economists and banks to contract by around 10% in the fiscal year ending in March.“High frequency indicators of agricultural activity, the purchasing managers index and certain private estimates on unemployment point to some stabilisation of economic activity in the second quarter of the current year,” Das told members of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry’s national executive committee.“The recovery is not yet fully entrenched,” he said.“By all indications, the recovery is likely to be gradual as efforts towards re-opening of the economy are confronted with rising infections.”Despite India seeing one of the strictest lockdowns in the world, the country has crossed 5 million Covid-19 infections, and has the world’s second highest number of cases.Das also underlined the need to regulate non-bank finance companies (NBFCs) or shadow banks better, while highlighting the positive impact of the measures taken by the RBI to lowering borrowing costs for the government and corporates.The RBI has all these years followed a light touch regulation policy with regards to NBFCs, Das said, adding that it has now taken measures to ensure no large entity failed as IL&FS did in 2019.“The fragility, vulnerability of the NBFC sector is the main concern. They are still not at par with the banks in the matter of regulation and we don’t want a repeat of a crisis in another NBFC,” Das said.He said the government, regulators and industry will need to work jointly for revival of the economy, adding that more focus would be needed on human capital, productivity growth, exports, tourism and food processing.He said India’s participation in the global value chains (GVCs) has been lower than many emerging and developing countries and said domestic policies need to focus on the right mix of local and foreign content in exports while aiming to increase participation in the GVCs.“It is also important to learn from global experience and nurture those trade agreements that go beyond traditional market access issues,” he added.
Celina Jaitly has penned a heartbreaking note about losing her best friend, within a few years of losing her parents and a son. The actor is mother to three boys and lives with her husband Peter Haag and kids in Austria.Sharing a lovely picture with her late friend Viraj Rai on Instagram, Celina wrote, “Amongst all the terrible things that happened these 2 years, I must find the courage to say goodbye to my best friend too. It’s the kind of heartache you can feel in your bones. Dearest Viraj @virajrai17 you have no idea of the amount of happiness, laughter and encouragement you brought into my life.... 25 years of soul connection .... and now you are gone. Life will never be the same without you..... Viraaj ... I will never be the same without you..... Hold a place for me among the stars, one day we shall all be together again. Until then ... Auf Wiedersehen #restinpeace #friendinheaven #celinajaitly #celinajaitley #lossofalovedone #rip #heartbroken.”Celina had lost her father, one of her twin sons in 2017 and her mother in 2018. She went into depression post the tragic loss. She had told Gulf News in an interview, “You can never find closure when you lose the most important and valuable things in your life. Daddy had just passed away and suddenly mama too … My parents were so full of life and they were this young, military army couple. The truth is you can never get closure from losing your parents. But this movie helped me a vent a lot of emotions… I am not getting treatment in Austria for the past one year.”Her husband, hotelier Peter Haag, gave up his job in Dubai to move her and family to Austria. She told the portal, “Peter left his job because I was suffering from such severe depression that we had no option but to leave Dubai. He said: “Let’s go back to Austria and let us disconnect from everything till you get better. That really helped me and getting my husband’s support in this meant a lot.”
New claims for US jobless benefits inched down last week, but not by much, as a brief outburst of optimism about a new government aid package fizzled Thursday amid a continued impasse in Washington.New filings for unemployment assistance last week fell to 860,000, the Labor Department said Thursday, but despite the decline applications were higher than expected.A surge in workers filed for benefits amid the widespread business shutdowns in March at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, and though that wave is well past its peak, weekly filings remain far above the worst of the 2008-2010 global financial crisis.And nearly 29.8 million people continued to receive some form of government aid through the week ended August 29, the latest for which data was available, the Labor Department said, and analysts have grown increasingly concerned of a spiraling employment crisis.“While it is good the numbers are falling, their decline is tapering, so we have over a year to get to normal,” chief economist at the AFL-CIO trade union federation William Spriggs said on Twitter.The data comes amid a continued impasse in Washington over providing additional support to the battered US economy and help for workers who have lost their jobs.The $2.2 trillion CARES Act passed in March allowed people to receive benefits for an extended period, however, the extra $600 in weekly unemployment payments as well as a program to support small businesses have expired.Gridlock in WashingtonDemocratic House speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday repeated her pledge to continue discussions with the White House on a new spending package, but said Republicans are unwilling to compromise on the size.“We have a massive problem in our country,” she told reporters, adding “it’s hard to see how we can go any lower when you only have a greater needs.”President Donald Trump has balked at calls to ramp up support to struggling state and local governments.White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows threw cold water on hopes of ending the gridlock, saying on Thursday he was “not optimistic” that Pelosi would want to have “meaningful” conversation if dialogue resumes.Economists warn that the better-than-expected economic recovery so far, which has seen the housing market remain strong, could evaporate without more stimulus.“Failure on the part of policymakers to enact another fiscal relief package poses significant downside risks to the economy and labor market as the recovery appears to be losing momentum,” said Nancy Vanden Houten of Oxford Economics.The US is home to the world’s worst coronavirus outbreak but has shown signs of recovering from the economic hit caused by the lockdowns. The unemployment rate skyrocketed to 14.7 percent in April but has since dialed back to 8.4 percent.The latest data showed signs of improvement as the insured unemployment rate among people eligible for benefits fell 0.7 points to 8.6 percent in the week ended September 12. And the number of people receiving Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA), the program for those not normally eligible for benefits, declined by more than 200,000.Rubeela Farooqi of High Frequency Economics warned the decline in the insured unemployment rate could reflect people either being rehired, or exhausting their benefits.“The risk going forward continues to come from virus outbreaks and intermittent interruptions to activity,” she wrote in an analysis. “Overall, the labor market is less weak compared to April but remains at risk of permanent damage from repeated closures.”

National Conference provincial president Devender Singh Rana on Saturday sought declaration of medical emergency in Jammu in view of the ever-rising cases of Covid-19 and inadequate infrastructural facilities to tackle the crisis-like situation.“The overall scenario is quite grim and there is no room for complacency. It can prove catastrophic unless an emergent and proactive response is taken to save precious lives,” Rana said in a statement.Rana referred to reports where patients either not find beds for treatment or were in need of oxygen and ventilators. He said the government should have anticipated such a situation and taken necessary measures to ramp-up bed strength by earmarking the maximum number of available beds in each hospital. Private hospitals and nursing homes should have been roped in, besides setting up a hospital with at least a thousand beds, Rana said giving the example of such a facility created by the Punjab government.While lauding the frontline warriors for risking their lives by putting in best efforts to treat Covid-19 cases, he slammed the “poor infrastructural backup” in Jammu. Rana again drew the attention of the administration towards the paucity of beds, questioning how will just 608 beds of the total capacity of 2,637 beds in Government Medical College and associated hospitals in the Jammu city meet the requirements of Covid-19 patients.The situation is even worse in semi-urban, urban and rural areas, he pointed out, adding that availability of oxygen is very poor and dysfunctional ventilators are adding more top the worry, he added.Rana called for the immediate installation of liquid oxygen plant, oxygen generation plant and other plants in various hospitals besides similar facilities at various district-level hospitals to cater to the needs of peripheral health institutions.Rana reiterated the need to deploy senior officers for monitoring the situation which seems to be going out of control. “This is to be taken note of to instil confidence among the people who are becoming restive on seeing the pitiable situation of health facilities,” he added.
President Donald Trump on Saturday promised to put forth a female nominee in the coming week to fill the Supreme Court vacancy created by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, pushing the Republican-controlled Senate to consider the pick without delay.Taking the stage at a North Carolina rally to chants of “Fill that seat,” the president said he would nominate his selection despite Democrats’ objections. And, after conducting what he joked was a “very scientific poll” of the Fayetteville crowd as to whether supporters wanted a man or a woman, he declared the choice would be “a very talented, very brave woman.”He added that he did not yet know whom he would choose.“We win an election and those are the consequences,” said the president, who then seemed to signal that he’d be willing to accept a vote on his nominee during the lame duck period after the election. “We have a lot of time. We have plenty of time. We’re talking about January 20th.”But one Republican senator already broke ranks. Maine’s Susan Collins, who is in a tough reelection battle, said Saturday that she believed replacing Ginsburg should be the decision of the president who is elected November 3. Three more defections from the GOP ranks would be needed to stop Trump’s nominee from joining the court.At stake is a seat held by a justice who spent her final years on the bench as the unquestioned leader of the court’s liberal wing. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. vowed to call a vote for Trump’s nominee, but Democrats countered that Republicans should follow the precedent that GOP legislators set in 2016 by refusing to consider a Supreme Court choice in the run-up to an election.The impending clash over the vacant seat — when to fill it and with whom — scrambles the stretch run of a presidential race for a nation already reeling from the pandemic that has killed nearly 200,000 people, left millions unemployed and heightened partisan tensions and anger.McConnell pledged to Trump in a phone call Friday night to bring the choice to a vote though he has not said if it would be before the election. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said any selection should come after Nov. 3. “Voters should pick the president and the president should pick the justice to consider,” he said.The president this month added 20 more names to his roster of potential court nominees, and aides in recent days have focused on a short list heavy on female candidates, according to four White House aides and officials close to the process. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss private conversations.Those under close consideration for the high court include three women who are federal appeals court judges: Amy Coney Barrett, beloved among conservatives and an early favorite; Barbara Lagoa, who is Hispanic and comes from the battleground state of Florida; and Allison Jones Rushing, who clerked for Justice Clarence Thomas and for Neil Gorsuch, when the current Trump-appointed justice was an appeals court judge.McConnell, who sets the calendar in the Senate and has made judicial appointments his priority, declared unequivocally in a statement that Trump’s nominee would receive a confirmation vote. In 2016, McConnell refused to consider President Barack Obama’s nominee months before the election, eventually preventing a vote on Judge Merrick Garland.Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York convened a conference call with Democratic senators at midday Saturday, according to a person on the private call who was not authorized to discuss it publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. He told senators the “number one goal” must be to communicate the stakes of the confirmation vote.Schumer also warned that if Republicans push through the nominee, “nothing is off the table” for Senate rules changes to come, the person said.The death of Ginsburg, a champion of women’s rights and a pop culture icon, led to a wave of mourning, including an informal memorial at the Supreme Court and a protest outside McConnell’s house. It also seemed certain to stoke enthusiasm in both political parties as the election could now be viewed as referendum on the high court’s decisions, including the future of abortion rights.Democrats raised more than $60 million in the hours after Ginsburg’s death, indicating her passing has already galvanized the party’s base.A confirmation vote in the Senate is not guaranteed, even with a Republican majority.McConnell has launched a risky, unprecedented strategy. It could motivate conservative voters to rally behind Trump and GOP senators or it could push away moderates who prefer to see the Senate stick to norms or are fearful of a right-leaning court stripping away women’s right to choose an abortion.Typically, it takes several months to vet and hold hearings on a Supreme Court nominee, and time is short before November. Key senators may be reluctant to cast votes so close to the election. With a slim GOP majority, 53 seats in the 100-member chamber, Trump’s choice could afford to lose only a few.McConnell did not specify the timing. But trying for confirmation in a lame-duck session after the Nov. 3 election, if Trump had lost to Biden or Republicans had lost the Senate, would carry further political complications.Democrats immediate denounced McConnell’s move as hypocritical, pointing out that he refused to call hearings for Garland 237 days before the 2016 election. The 2020 election is 46 days away.The average number of days to confirm a justice, according to the Congressional Research Service, is 69, which would be after the election. But some Republicans quickly noted that Ginsburg was confirmed in just 42 days. Obama waited more than a month to nominate Garland after Justice Antonin Scalia died in February 2016.John Fischetti, who waited in line more than two hours to enter Trump’s Fayetteville rally, said replacing Ginsburg would inflame tensions but was within the president’s rights.“I would assume it would make everyone more energized,” Fischetti said of the political repercussions. “Trump’s people want him to always press forward.”Four GOP defections could defeat a nomination, while a tie vote could be broken by Vice President Mike Pence. After Collins’ decision, focus grew on Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitt Romney of Utah, who have been critical of Trump and protective of the institution of the Senate.And because the Arizona Senate race is a special election, that seat could be filled as early as Nov. 30 — which would narrow the window for McConnell if the Democratic candidate, Mark Kelly, wins.The next pick could shape important decisions beyond abortion rights, including any legal challenges that may stem from the 2020 election. In the interim, if the court were to take cases with eight justices, 4-4 ties would revert the decision to a lower court; for instance, the Affordable Care Act could then be struck down by a lower Texas court.Biden has promised to nominate a Black woman to the high court if given the chance. His campaign reiterated Saturday that it would release names before the election.
India has been ranked at the 116th position in the latest edition of the World Bank’s annual Human Capital Index that benchmarks key components of human capital across countries.However, India’s score increased to 0.49 from 0.44 in 2018, as per the Human Capital Index report released by the World Bank on Wednesday.The 2020 Human Capital Index update includes health and education data for 174 countries – covering 98% of the world’s population – up to March 2020, providing a pre-pandemic baseline on the health and education of children, with the biggest strides made in low-income countries.The analysis shows that pre-pandemic, most countries had made steady progress in building human capital of children, with the biggest strides made in low-income countries.Despite this progress, and even before the effects of the pandemic, a child born in a typical country could expect to achieve just 56% of their potential human capital, relative to a benchmark of complete education and full health, the Bank said.“The pandemic puts at risk the decade’s progress in building human capital, including the improvements in health, survival rates, school enrollment, and reduced stunting. The economic impact of the pandemic has been particularly deep for women and for the most disadvantaged families, leaving many vulnerable to food insecurity and poverty,” said World Bank Group President David Malpass.Protecting and investing in people is vital as countries work to lay the foundation for sustainable, inclusive recoveries and future growth.Due to the pandemic’s impact, most children – more than 1 billion – have been out of school and could lose out, on average, half a year of schooling, adjusted for learning, translating into considerable monetary losses. Data also shows significant disruptions to essential health services for women and children, with many children missing out on crucial vaccinations.Last year, India had raised “serious reservations” over the Human Capital Index, wherein India was ranked 115 out of 157 countries. This year India finds itself at 116th from among 174 countries.When asked about India’s objections last year, Roberta Gatti, the bank’s chief economist for human development, told reporters that her team has worked with countries to improve the quality of data in order to make it a better index for everyone.“An index is a conversation-opener, and what we have discussed with our client countries is that all that is in the index matters, but not everything that matters can be in the index,” she said.“We have worked very directly with some of our client countries to use the index as a way to improve measurement, and India was exactly one of these cases,” Gatti said.Responding to questions, Mamta Murthi, Vice President, Human Development, World Bank Group, told reporters that the Human Capital Index provides a basis on which the government of India can prioritize and a dimension to support human capital. Given the progress that has been made in recent times, it seems significant for now due to Covid-19. The Bank is working with the Indian authorities on supporting livelihood for the poor, which is very important, she said.World Bank President David Malpass said that the coronavirus has deepened inequality globally, in addition to increasing poverty and distress. “We’re working with countries to try to protect people during the crisis and also invest in them so that we can see the recovery and lay a foundation for future inclusive growth,” he said.The impact of Covid-19, on developing countries particularly has been hard, Malpass said adding that there is the collapse of the formal and informal market, and also there is a very limited social safety net. The World Bank, he said, estimates a 12% drop in employment.There has been major decline in remittances and total income is going down by 11 or 12%. All this, he said is likely to have a disproportionate effect on the poor and on women. India, he said is having “severe impact” of Covid-19.Malpass said that there’s two-fold inequality in this crisis. “One is that developing countries are being left further behind. And within developing countries, the poor are being left further behind. “Our concern right now with the pandemic is the subtractions or the challenges facing human capital creation in this environment,” he said.He further said, “countries are increasingly reporting declines in essential health services. Eighty million children are missing out on essential vaccinations. Most children, within more than a billion children, have been out of school due to Covid-19. And that could lose as much as USD 10 trillion in lifetime earnings because of the reduced learning, the school closing and the potential for dropping out of school and the disproportionate impact on girls”.Malpass said that the World Bank is trying to work to restart the learning process, including by helping countries secure access to equipment, assisting in reopening, and with distance learning.
A group of 55 Class 10 students of city school have started a crowdfunding initiative to help small farmers in Marathwada set up a basic brick and mortar storage facility, designed by a startup from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. The storage facility will help farmers store their produce for up to a week and overcome the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.The students, all from the Bombay Scottish School in Mahim, set out to raise around Rs 16 lakh that can help over 100 farmers in Marathwada to set up the Subjee Cooler, a cooling unit designed by Rukart Technologies. While a unit can be set up at Rs 30,000, many farmers do not have the funds at their disposal owing to the effects of the lockdown on the markets, said Vikas Jha, founder of Rukart.“If we could find finance for half the price, farmers were willing to pay the other half,” he added.The students found out about the plight of the farmers during a workshop at school with crowd-funding platform—Fuel a Dream. Each student then decided to raise Rs 30,000 to be able to help two farmers set up Subjee Coolers. However, many students have already exceeded their goals and the funds will be used to help more farmers. “I honestly went into the campaign thinking I’d barely touch the goal of Rs 30000 and I was pleasantly surprised by the outcome. I’m currently at Rs 1,29,100. The first day, I texted and called close friends and relatives about the campaign,” said 14-year-old Auroni Gupta, who claimed that most contributions came through social media. So far the students have raised Rs13.87 lakh.The Subjee Cooler works on the principle of evaporative cooling and does not require any utilities except watering once a day.According to Jha, the cooling chamber temperature is lesser than the ambient temperature by a margin of 5-15°C (depends on ambient relative humidity) and maintains the high relative humidity of above 85% - 90% inside the cooling chamber. The low temperature and high humidity inside the chamber preserve the vegetable crop (non-tuber) for five to eight days.“Rukart and a Pune-based non-profit Swayam Sikashan Prayog, got in touch with us about the farmers in Marathwada. We have been doing workshops with students across the country and the students at Bombay Scottish showed interest. That’s how the initiative took off,” said Ranganath Thota, founder of Fuel a Dream, who teaches crowdfunding as a skill to school students.
Jammu and Kashmir lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha on Saturday announced a Rs 1,350 crore economic package for the revival of the business sector in the Union territory, along with a 50 per cent rebate on electricity and water bills for a one-year period.Addressing a press conference on Saturday, Sinha said, “I am glad to announce a Rs 1,350 crores economic package for the people in the business community facing economic difficulties. This is additional to the benefits of Atma Nirbhar Bharat and other measures taken by us to comfort the business community.”Under the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (self-reliance campaign) of the Central government, the L-G said, Rs 1400 crore have already been provided to the people of the UT through the Jammu and Kashmir Bank.“For one year, we will be giving a 50 per cent concession in water and electricity bills. We will be spending Rs 105 crore on this. This will benefit farmers, normal people, businessman and others,” the L-G said. “This is a beginning and more things are in the offing.”He added that the government is working on a structured mechanism and package for taxi drivers, transporters, autorickshaw drivers, houseboat owners, shikarawallas and others who have been affected by the economic slowdown amid the Covid-19 pandemic.“We are setting up a customised help tourism scheme by the Jammu and Kashmir Bank for financial assistance to persons associated with the tourism sector with attractive pricing and repayment features. We are setting up an exclusive land bank and will make available land for warehouses in industrial estates and food parks,” Sinha said.The main component of the ‘Business Revival Package’, Sinha said, is a 5 per cent interest subvention to all borrowers irrespective of their sizes. “You know that at the most, a two-per cent interest subvention is provided and that is what the people expect as well. However, keeping in mind the special situation here -- businesses have been suffering for the last about 20 years -- we have decided to give an interest subvention of five per cent without any discrimination to all businesses whether small, medium or heavy. This is an unprecedented decision,” he said. The Union Territory administration will directly support this with Rs 950 crore, he added.The L-G also announced that stamp duty has been exempted for all borrowers till March 2021. “From October 1, J&K bank will set up special desk for the youth and women entrepreneurs,” he said.The administration has also decided to assist bus drivers/conductors, auto/taxi drivers etc, who may have lost their livelihood, by providing for an appropriate mechanism. “A further 50% or Rs 5 lakh subsidy, whichever is lower, shall provided to the transporters for replacement of old buses and the insurance premium shall be borne by the Government,” Sinha announced.He also announced that those associated with the handloom and handicraft sectors will get an enhanced credit of Rs 2 lakh in their credit cards as also a seven-per cent interest subvention to improve these sectors.“Overall, this economic package is historic in terms of volume and reach. I can see that Kashmiris are eager to contribute to the growth of the Union Territory as they are fed up with the cross-border terrorism sponsored by our neighbour. I strongly feel that it is our collective responsibility to ensure that a lot of money goes into creation of jobs, strengthening of businesses and coming together of families for a quick bounce-back of Jammu and Kashmir’s economy,” Sinha said.The L-G had constituted a committee on August 18 to assess the help required by the business community of Jammu and Kashmir and also suggest administrative measures to boost banking, industry, tourism, agriculture and handicrafts.The committee, headed by K K Sharma, the advisor to the L-G, submitted its report on September 1 after deliberations with at least 35 business organisations from Srinagar and Jammu.The package also includes the Guaranteed Emergency Credit Loan (GECL), Working Capital Demand Loan (WCDL) facility for Private Educational Institutions and the J&K Business Support Loan Scheme for hotels and guest houses, which are likely to be rolled out soon.Welcoming the package, Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industries’ president Shiekh Ashiq said that Sinha has kept his promise. “The business community appreciates this gesture of the government. We are going through the components of the package and if there will be any shortcoming, we will again meet the Lt Governor. We are really thankful for this package.”(With Agency inputs)

The peace agreement between Israel, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Bahrain is a historic moment that brings together the most advanced states in West Asia for the good of humanity. Combining forces and finding common ground has never been more urgent than now, in the midst of a pandemic, and the Abraham Accord is set to generate immediate results. This historic agreement also brings opportunities for India, which enjoys strong bilateral relations with these developed and thriving economies. India will benefit greatly by expanding its cooperation in many areas including health care, energy, agriculture, cyber security, regional security, technology, water and more.The leaders of Israel, the United States (US) and the UAE hailed the agreement as a “historic diplomatic breakthrough that will advance peace in the Middle East”, “chart a new path”, and “unlock the great potential in the region”. India’s ministry of external affairs praised the agreement between Israel and the UAE, defining both as “key strategic partners of India”. The scope for successful collaboration among the three countries is huge. For example, the health ministers of both Israel and the UAE have already agreed to cooperate on health issues, particularly on the coronavirus. Meanwhile, Israel and India have also been cooperating on joint research and development for rapid testing of Covid-19, as well as new technologies to combat the pandemic.Developing together, and subsequently utilising the significant relative advantage of India in manufacturing, can bring promising results for the sake of humanity and the whole world, as well as harmonising with the great vision of Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi of “Making in India, for India, and for the world”.While business delegations and a student exchange programme are being planned, the UAE and Israel have also committed to working together on medical research and pharmaceuticals, collaborating particularly in the development of treatments and vaccine trials for Covid-19. Apex National Investment has signed a memorandum of understanding with Israel’s Sheba Medical Center, establishing Israel as a major destination for medical tourism from the UAE. Both countries have suffered under the ongoing coronavirus crisis, and it’s, therefore, fitting that the first field of cooperation is in health care.Like India, Israel and the UAE are young countries that have managed to develop dynamic, thriving economies in a few decades. Both the UAE and Israel will gain from the expansion of trade and commercial ties. The Israeli ministry of economy and industry has estimated that Israeli exports to the UAE could jump to $500 million a year, and that Emirati investments in Israel could reach $350 million a year. The cyber-security, medical, financial, and communications industries are expected to benefit in particular from the newfound expansion of trade and investment between the two countries. Given that both countries are strategic partners of India, we can imagine the promising potential that is embedded in this exciting peace agreement.These initiatives and collaborations represent a bit of what is to come in the normalisation of relations between Israel, the UAE, and Bahrain. The citizens of all three countries will quickly see their lives enriched as a result of this agreement, paving the way for increasingly more countries in the region to realise the vast potential that exists in making peace with Israel. As economic opportunities in the region arise, they will also expand beyond the immediate region to benefit our friends in India.The challenges we are facing today know no borders, and it is essential that we combine our capabilities for the benefit of all of our citizens. We call on all those following this historic moment to voice their support for the agreement. This historic peace agreement opens a new era of peace and prosperity for the whole of West Asia, India, and the world.Ron Malka is Israel’s ambassador to IndiaThe views expressed are personal
You have to pass a test before I let you read this week’s write-up. Get up and go in front of the mirror. Carefully look at the photo of the girl on this page and then at yourself in the mirror. Ensure that your facial expression is as pathetic, forlorn and sad, if not more. Khabardaar agar smile kiya toh! Through advanced augmented reality, I’ll get to know who is smiling, and my curse will ensure your face bears a constipated look every single time you get photographed for the rest of your life. Those of you who haven’t got married yet, apni wedding albums ke bare mein soch lo. Now with the serious face, try to understand my point this week. After leading an utterly useless life that involved baring my teeth and giggling away to glory at the slightest provocation, I have finally found a mission in life.Read| A Calmer You, by Sonal Kalra: Quit the guilt and talk to your parentsTo attain, and help everyone around me attain a state of zero sense of humour. Because in the past few days, some people have helped me realise that laughter is the silliest of human emotions. That it is frivolous and wasteful to tickle the funny bone when you can utilise that time to indulge in critical and meaningful activities like getting offended and preaching morals. And haven’t you noticed, serious people are way cooler than us idiots who can’t contain their laughter and let out strange, gurgling sounds from the throat. Toh maine toh decide kar liya. No cracking jokes. In any case, most people don’t get my twisted sense of humour. And it gets me into trouble often.Last week I went to the neighbourhood park for a walk, and then sat on the bench to watch kids play on swings. A woman sitting next to me tried to strike a conversation and asked which of the children was mine. Intently gazing ahead with a devilish expression, I replied, “I’m still trying to decide”. Before I could pat my back on my brilliant joke, the woman had rushed to collect her child and warn others about the demented kidnapper on the bench. Reputation barbaad in the colony, permanently. Hasna hi nahi ji mujhe ab...Read| A Calmer You, By Sonal Kalra: Stubborn people around? Here’s how to retain your composureAnd this came exactly a day after a police constable scolded me, when, on seeing a roadside sign that said ‘Yeh bus-stop aage chala gaya hai’, I scribbled underneath, ‘Usey jaane kisne diya?’ I got a long lecture about how padhe-likhe people should not indulge in mazaak. Anyway, his scolding was justified, but this thing of how I can be cool, mysterious and intellectual only if I’m serious in life has entered my head strongly now. So, for myself, and for all of you who need growing up, here are tips to become permanently serious.1. Be a joke killer: Go to a temple and take the oath that you’ll never let a joke break your resolve of not laughing like mad people who have no control over their emotions. If someone tells a joke, stare at them as if they’ve lost it. In fact, read up all the jokes on the net, so that if someone tries telling a joke, you can kill their punchline, or make that genius remark, ‘Suna hua hai. Puraana hai’. I’ve seen people do this to others’ jokes and although all this while I hated such spoilsports, now suddenly I have newfound respect for them. In fact, I demand a special reward for those brave people who take pride in saying ‘Hamein toh hansi nahi aayi’ when someone tells a joke. They are the real assets because of who India continues to hold a serious position in the global scenario, otherwise the velapanti gang of non-serious people would have laughingly destroyed our image. Flippant fools, I tell you.2. Take everything literally: Wipe off the concept of metaphors or clever phrases from your head. Be an expert at missing the point and start taking everything anyone says literally. You may be branded as an annoying ass but so what? It’s all for a good cause. Argue endlessly with people as if they mean everything they’ve said. Slowly people will start avoiding saying anything non serious in front of you. The shallow frivolities will be out and life will become meaningful.3. Make a mental bank of sad thoughts: Since I’m trying it out these days, let me tell you that reaching the zero sense of humour stage is not as easy as it sounds. Your body will want to revolt, a smile will try hard to escape your mouth in certain situations. But you have to be strong. What really helps is having a bank of sad thoughts in your head. The moment something funny starts to happen around you, retrieve an image from the bank. It could be the first time you got thrashed by the school teacher, or the moment when your girlfriend made you spend all your pocket money in a single date, or the state of poverty in Africa, or the rising corruption in our country. Anything that’ll keep you from feeling happy at that moment. I’ll personally congratulate you once you’ll reach that level of turning sad anytime you want to. What an achievement sir ji!4. Act depressed: This is tough, but together we can manage it if we try really hard. Stop wearing bright colours, switch over to earthy, dull shades. Keep your eyes a bit droopy all the time, and your expression confused and fed up. When you say something, don’t let even a hint of enthusiasm enter your voice. If someone else tries to speak to you, say ‘hain?’ with an utterly irritated expression at least thrice. Make them feel as if they are THE burden on Mother Earth and should not take the risk of saying anything non-serious in front of you. Every once in a while, go on facebook and leave sad, preachy comments on the so-called funny status updates. Do it on my timeline too. Oh, you already do so? Okay.5 Make fraandship only with serious people: Stick to people who are unfunny since birth. I once found one such woman in a hospital. She said she was there to ‘donate’ her eyes, rather than ‘pledging’ her eyes for donation. So I asked her, with all genuineness, if she had someone to take her back home since she won’t be able to see. She shouted so rudely at me that for a moment I was also tempted to be equally rude and add that if she decides to donate her entire body, a hungry family of four in certain countries could survive just on her right thigh for a year, but stopped myself just in time to avoid being slapped. I have now decided to pursue her till she makes me her best friend. Together we’ll spend our lives, spreading the message of seriousness all around us. Amen.Sonal Kalra declares that nothing will make her laugh anymore.

Actor Nia Sharma welcomed her 30s in style on Wednesday. She took to Instagram to share pictures and videos her birthday celebrations.The pictures show how Nia cut 10 cakes at once, sang her own birthday song and partied with her friends to hit songs. Nia wore a two-piece dress with a tube top and a short skirt. She tied her hair in a bun and wore sneakers. “A birthday’s been like a festival Every year since last 10...fills my eyes up and heart with pride...immense gratitude and shall forever be indebted to each and everyone who’s made every Birthdayyyyyy and every occasion so f#%**g special every f*%%ng timeeeee!! @vinayyshrma thank youuuuuu for everything I’m spoilt. Cake count 18,” she captioned her post.Speaking to India Forums about her birthday, Nia said, “From an ugly duckling to a grown woman, I have lived my small dreams of living an independent life in Mumbai, earning a living for myself, standing on my own feet, I earned it all with dignity. Television has made it all possible for me. I am quite content with my journey till here and what I take immense pride in is the love I have received from the fans over the years who celebrate your every little achievement like a festival.’’Nia was last seen in Khatron Ke Khiladi Made In India, where she emerged as the winner. Nia was also seen in the last season of Naagin.In a recent interview with Hindustan Times, Nia said about her career: “I couldn’t be happier of how my career has turned out. I remember, I was such a raw girl, who didn’t even use a kajal in college, unlike collegiates today who are so fashionable. I was an ugly duckling, a simpleton and a girl next door. But I aspired to be fashionable and walk out of stores with huge shopping bags. Ever since my acting career started, I have groomed myself to become the person I am today. It has been a self-processed journey.”
The government’s decision to dispense with Question Hour during the monsoon session of Parliament has irked the Opposition. They have accused the government of using the pandemic as an excuse to do away with an important instrument of legislative oversight of the executive.However, the fact remains that several Members of Parliament (MPs) are unable to make the best use of the Question Hour on account of frequent disruptions. A study carried out by the Rajya Sabha secretariat showed that nearly 60% of the time allotted to Question Hour over the past five years was lost due to disruptions.There is no specific rule in the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business (Rules) of the two Houses for suspension of Question Hour. The leaders of all political parties in the Rajya Sabha had agreed to shift Question Hour to noon instead of the time-honoured “first hour of every sitting” or 11 am. This change was brought about in 2014 and continues till today. Every sitting of the Rajya Sabha begins with the so-called and undefined Zero Hour, in which MPs are allowed to raise matters of immediate concern with the permission of the Chair. If that is the stated order of priority of the members, the dropping of Question Hour but retaining Zero Hour should serve their purpose. In any case, before dropping Question Hour from the proceedings of the two Houses, the government held extensive consultations with various political parties and the majority, given the time constraints and the consequent need for shortening the agenda, was in favour of retaining a truncated Zero Hour, while dispensing with Question Hour.As regards grilling the executive and performing the function of legislative oversight, skillfully-drafted questions for written answers serve the purpose much more effectively. It requires a deep understanding of the topic and the current policies of the government on the subject. Moreover, there are several other instruments which can execute the task better. First and foremost is the notice for calling attention. Through this, a member may call the attention of a minister to any matter of urgent public importance and the minister may make a brief statement in reply.Then, there is the Half-an-Hour Discussion on a question, the reply to which can be oral or written. There is also a provision for Special Mention in the Rajya Sabha (rule 180A-180F) and “Raising a matter which is not a point of order” in the Lok Sabha (rule 377). The latter is a structured device whereby a member may read out or lay on the table a statement on a matter of public importance. The minister concerned, conventionally, responds to it within one month. These instruments, if used optimally and judiciously, are quite effective in enforcing accountability of the executive.However, in order to compensate the members for their inability to ask supplementary questions, follow-up questions on subsequent days and seeking more information on a question asked earlier may be also allowed, in relaxation of rule 47 (2) (xiv) of the Rajya Sabha rules and rule 41 (2) (xiii) of the Lok Sabha rules, which prohibit questions on subjects on which questions have already been answered during the session. Such questions may be admitted till the last day of the Monsoon Session, that is October 1 and replies sent by email or post subsequently. Further, the ceiling on the number questions to be admitted for written replies, which at present stands at 175 in the Rajya Sabha and 230 in the Lok Sabha, may be raised to say 200 and 300 respectively.Zero Hour too has been curtailed, but the members could perhaps make better use of the instrument of Special Mention /Raising a Matter to compensate for lost opportunities. As a matter of fact, Special Mention was introduced as a better-structured alternative to Zero Hour.Vivek K Agnihotri, IAS (retd) is former secretary-general, Rajya SabhaThe views expressed are personal
Bollywood actor Kangana Ranaut and singer Anup Jalota have lauded Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath for announcing plans to set up the country’s ‘biggest and most beautiful film city’ in Gautam Buddh Nagar district of UP.In a set of two tweets from @KanganaTeam on Saturday, Ranaut said, “People’s perception that the top film industry in India is the Hindi film industry is wrong. Telugu film industry has ascended itself to the top position and now catering films to pan India in multiple languages, many Hindi films being shot in Ramoji (film city) Hyderabad. I applaud this announcement by @myogiadityanath ji. We need many reforms in the film industry first of all we need one big film industry called Indian film industry. We are divided based on many factors. Hollywood films get advantage of this. One industry but many film cities.”Ranaut’s comments are significant due to her ongoing war of words with Shiv Sena over her comments on an alleged drugs culture in Bollywood and a legal battle with the Mumbai civic body over the demolition of her office in the city. Ranaut, recently said she was leaving Mumbai with a heavy heart after visiting the city for a few days under protection of Y category security provided by the centre in the wake of alleged threats by Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut warning her against coming to Mumbai.In a video message, Jalota said, “I thank and congratulate UP CM Yogi Adityanath on the announcement of film city in UP. Mumbai film industry shines because of talents from UP. Now, when UP will have a film city, UP will shine.”Also Read: Yogi Adityanath orders land hunt for India’s biggest film city near NoidaDuring a meeting to review development works in Meerut division, comprising Meerut, Ghaziabad, Bulandshahr, Hapur, Baghpat and Gautam Buddh Nagar districts, through videoconferencing on Friday night, Yogi had asked officials to find a suitable land in or around Noida for setting up the film city.Also Read: Ranvir Shorey: ‘A group of people always defend the unfair practices in Bollywood’“The CM, while addressing a review meeting, announced to set up the biggest and most beautiful film city of the country in Gautam Buddh Nagar.

The 24-run loss to England in the low-scoring second ODI here must have been a “real punch in the guts” for Australia, says spin legend Shane Warne. After England posted 231 for nine on a surface on which runs were hard to come by, Australia made a good start before a dramatic collapse saw them slip from 144 for two in the run chase to be 207 all-out.“Australia hadn’t played cricket for quite a long time so you sort of excuse them (that collapse) in the first T20, even though it cost them that series,” Warne told ‘Sky Sports’, referring to the first T20I where Australia slumped from 124-2 to 148-6 to lose the game by two runs.“They have been pretty good since then but this will be a real punch in the guts for Australia. They pride themselves on getting over the line in those sorts of games and doing the basics well.“They didn’t do that - they weren’t good enough, with Aaron Finch the only batsman to really show any touch. It’s 1-1 ahead of the last day of the international summer. Who writes these scripts?”From 149 for eight, England went on to make 231 for nine, courtesy Tom Curran (37 off 39 balls) and Adil Rashid (35 off 26), who shared a 76-run stand for England’s ninth wicket. “Australia got it a bit wrong. They tried to go for wickets and didn’t sum up conditions and think ‘hard length at the stumps is tough for the batsmen so it should be the same for the tail’. They got a bit greedy trying to knock them over,” Warne said.The three-match series is now levelled at 1-1. The two teams will now meet in the series-decider on Wednesday.

There have been times when Rohit Sharma has given up his preferred opening spot to add stability to the Mumbai Indians middle-order, but the MI captain hinted that he will be starting as an opener when IPL 2020 kickstarts with the defending champions taking on CSK in the tournament opener on September 19. That said, Rohit mentioned that he will keep options open as far as his batting position is concerned.Also Follow | IPL 2020 Full CoverageRohit, who opened throughout the last edition, said he is ready to bat anywhere based on the demands of the team management.“I think I opened the entire tournament last year and will continue to do that even in this year,” Rohit said responding to a question of Hindustan Times during a virtual press conference organised by the franchise on Thursday.Also Read | Five records Rohit Sharma holds for Mumbai IndiansRohit, whose career took an upward turn when he began opening the batting regularly for India in limited-overs cricket, said he enjoys batting at the top.Rohit Sharma’s numbers at various batting positions. ( Sportz Interactive )“I keep all the options open, whatever the team wants, I’m happy to do that. I enjoy batting at the top of the order, I’ve been doing that for a while, I really enjoy that. Even when I play for India, the message from my side to the management is that do not close any doors keep all the options open, I’ll do that here as well,” he said.Also Read |Five bowlers who are strong contenders to win Purple Cap in UAEIn the 2017 and 2018 editions of the IPL, Rohit opened only twice in 30 innings. The move did not turn out well as the dynamic right-hander scored only 333 runs at an average of 23.78 in 2017 – when he did not open in the entire tournament – and 286 runs at an average of 23.83. These two IPL seasons have been Rohit’s worst in terms runs, average and strike-rate.Rohit’s numbers improved in the last edition when he decided to go back at the top, scoring 405 runs at an average of 28.92.Last year, Rohit’s opening partner was South Africa wicket-keeper batsman Quinton de Kock. While MI have bolstered their squad with the addition of Australia opener Chris Lynn and they also have Ishan Kishan, who has achieved a lot of success at the top of the order, MI head coach Mahela Jayawardena said they will stick to the Rohit-de Kock combination at the start.“Having options in the squad is always great Lynn is obvious a great addition. Quinton has been phenomenal for us, his combination with Rohit has really worked. So why fix something when it’s not broke? So we’ll look to continue with that,” Jayawardene said.“But having Lynny as an option gives us flexibility. We try and add more value to the team so that we are not predictable. But definitely Quinton and Ro have been a great combination for us.”
The direct message (DM) had landed early morning. At 6.45am, to be precise. By the time I woke up, a few more DMs had pushed it down. It was May 2020. Those days, most of the volunteers of India Cares had a very erratic schedule. We would sleep around 3am and wake up late in the morning.Like all other days, the first thing I did was to open my Twitter DMs. There was this DM from Shailja in Hyderabad. Not one but a couple of them, all peppered with short sentences.‘Sir, please save me.’‘We have not eaten anything for last 6 days.’‘I am from Hyderabad. I stay with my husband and in-laws.’‘Sir, they are talking about committing suicide. My husband asked me. I don’t want to die, sir. Please save me.’I was half asleep while scrolling through the DMs, but by the time I finished the last sentence, I was sitting up straight, wide awake. The first thing I checked was the time. It was 9.20am. Her last DM was at 6.45am. It had already been more than two-and-a-half hours. “Am I late?,” was my first thought.IPS officer Arun Bothra.‘Hello, can we talk?’‘Hello, don’t worry. We can help’‘Hello’‘Hello’‘Don’t worry. Everything will be okay’‘Please send your number. I will call’My DMs to her were getting delivered but she had not read them. Was I late? I couldn’t shrug the thought off.How do I reach her? How to alert the local authorities? What if they’ve done something unthinkable in the last two hours? Oh, why didn’t I wake up earlier? My brain was racing and the heart sinking.On Twitter, she had no display picture, or the more colloquial ‘DP’. Her ‘bio’ was a single word — ‘Housewife’. The account had been opened in May 2020. I had seen many people joining social media during the lockdown, just to seek help. All this quick investigation gave no clue that could lead to her. Meanwhile, I kept checking my DMs to see if she had replied. There was none.‘Hello’‘Hello’‘Hello, please talk to me. All will be okay.’‘Hello’I kept messaging after every few minutes. After a nerve-wracking wait of more than an hour, she finally responded.‘Hello sir’‘Sorry sir, I did not check my phone.’She sent her number. I immediately called her up. She narrated the ordeal her family had been undergoing. For the last three days, they had survived only on water. By the time the conversation got over, she was sobbing. A word of sympathy, an assurance of help melted her.In less than an hour, two India Cares volunteers were at her gate with a ration kit. By that time, out of sheer desperation, I had already called two more contacts in Hyderabad. The family got two more bags full of ration that evening.At 3pm, Shailja sent me picture of her kitchen. She had cooked after many days. I saw her for the first time. A frail young lady with a sheepish smile. The picture is etched into my memory permanently.I always knew that being able to help someone is therapeutic, especially unknown souls who may never cross our path again. What I did not know is that such efforts also bring some scars. On some days, we have heartaches to heal, too.One day, I got a call from a volunteer — a young and passionate girl. In those three months of lockdown, she must have managed to help dozens of people, almost single handedly. She was crying. What happened? Was this another ego clash between young volunteers? But that couldn’t have affected her so much. What was it then?As she composed herself and started telling the story, I was moved by her empathy. She was helping a young patient, had arranged for his hospitalisation. Then, for medicines and blood. Even food for the caretakers. For almost five-six days she was totally engrossed in taking care of this young boy. However, he could not make it through. He had expired the previous night. The young girl could not handle the trauma. She cried and cried. And I, for once, did not know what to say to her. I just waited for her to calm down, tried to console her with some meaningless philosophy.A month or so later, during a web meeting, it did strike me to ask her about the family of that young patient. Luckily, I refrained myself from doing so at the last minute. I would have probably scratched the wound in her soul, inadvertently.Seva isn’t joyous always. There are moments of despair and loss as well. It doesn’t always bring joy. At times, it brings tears. Tears that wash your soul.Disclaimer: The writer is an IPS officer and runs an NGO called India Cares. The views are his own.
At the forthcoming annual general meeting of the Indian Civil and Administrative Services (Central) Association, scheduled for September 5, on the agenda is a proposal to change the association’s name to the Central (Indian Administrative Services (IAS) Association. Dropping the Indian Civil Services (ICS) from the nomenclature was long overdue. This would set aside some of the anomalies of the colonial-era ICS and IAS forever.First, contrary to what many commentators still believe, the IAS was not instituted by the colonial rulers. Rather, the then secretary of state wanted to end the covenant of the civilians well before the transfer of power. It was Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who, as the interim home minister of the transition government, decided to create the IAS. This had the endorsement of eight of the 11 provinces in British India. Punjab, Bengal and Sindh were the three states that opposed his proposal as their political leaderships did not see their future with India. Patel launched IAS with the stirring words: “You will not have a united India, unless you have a good All India service, which has the Independence to speak out its mind.”Induction into the IAS started in 1948, and it had a different mandate from its earlier avatar. The two guiding leitmotifs were: Unity of India and independence of mind. While the former is clearly understood, the latter did not mean that service members were completely free to do anything of their choice. What it implies is that members of the service must put across their points of views without fear or favour, and must be non-partisan in their approach. In fact, Article 311, which gives security to the civil service members, has hardly any parallel in the world. It means that the service members are free to give their viewpoints, but they must also accept the mandate of the political executive as envisaged by the Constitution. All new entrants to the civil services take an oath, or make a solemn affirmation to this treatise framed under the chairmanship of BR Ambedkar.It’s also the time to break the myth that the ICS was the epitome of good governance. This is clear from the representations ICS members made to the secretary of state regarding supersession, adverse entries and unfair comparisons. In 1947, there was considerable resentment among the Punjabis against Lt Governor Evan Meredith Jenkins, who was junior to the financial commissioner. Many field officers felt that Jenkins conveyed to the Viceroys (Wavell and Mountbatten) only what they wanted to hear. Again, the unfair treatment meted out to Surendra Nath Banerjee and the first set of Indian officers has been well-documented.I would go as far as to say that the IAS is a cut above the ICS. It attracts the best and the brightest women and men. The ICS was a misogynist organisation, which refused to allow women into its fold. In fact, when the first woman IAS officer Anna Rajam Malhotra (nee George) cleared the exam in 1951, the four-member board of the Union Public Service Commission (all ex-ICS officers, led by Chairman RN Banerjee) tried their best to dissuade her from joining the service. But having won her spurs – in horse-riding as well as pistol-shooting, which were mandatory in those days – she got her first posting. Now, on average, women constitute over one-third of the strength of an IAS batch.It must be said that because the brightest and the best minds join the civil services, one can, and should, expect them to improve systems, deliver better results on the ground and strive for excellence as well as transparency. But it should also be kept in mind that they are not magicians. The context and vision are the driving force. Fortunately for us, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during his address to the officer trainees at the Statue of Unity last year, gave the civil services a clear mandate. This, he said, was “to fulfil the dream of a New India with the 21st-century thinking … dreams are indispensable in our bureaucracy – a bureaucracy that is constructive, imaginative, innovative, proactive and polite, professional and progressive, energetic and enabling, efficient and effective, transparent and tech enabled the civil services can, and will deliver in a time frame.”In delinking our name from the ICS, the IAS has announced, once and for all, that we cannot be treated in the framework of the Raj. Like the Ship of Theseus, we have been completely transformed--our mandate, outreach, commitment, professionalism as well as the values inculcated in the academy--named after Lal Bahadur Shastri--are quite different from the ICS’s syllabus or the first decade when training took place in Delhi’s Metcalfe House.We have moved ahead a long way and we have moved away. We are now proud to say that we don’t any longer need to be tied to the apron strings of the colonial service.Sanjeev Chopra is director, Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of AdministrationThe views expressed are personal
Adani Green Energy on Friday posted a consolidated net profit of Rs 21.75 crore for June quarter mainly on the back of higher revenues. The company had a net loss of Rs 97.44 crore in April-June 2019-20, a BSE filing said. Total income rose to Rs 878.14 crore in April-June 2020-21 from Rs 675.23 crore in the same period last year.The net export (of electricity) increased to 1,382 million units in the first quarter, up 24 per cent from the year-ago period. The firm is in the business of renewable energy.“The Group (firm) has serviced all the debts obligations during the quarter without opting for moratorium as directed by Reserve Bank of India for interest and principal instalments falling due to banks and other financial institutions / lenders,” the filing said.About the impact of Covid-19 pandemic, it said,”the management believes that the impact of this outbreak on the business and financial position of the Group is not significant.” Commenting on the results Gautam Adani, Chairman, Adani Green Energy said,“The growing domestic and international demand for cleaner and greener technology, has accelerated the green energy transition in the country and we are prepared to lead this change.” “Today, sustainability and economy go hand in hand and as such the goals of the organization must be aligned with the needs of the nation. The definitive steps taken by us in this journey are calculated to meet our ESG goals at each turn,” he added.This quarter, the company has cemented its place in the global renewable space by winning the world’s largest solar bid and with this it has been ranked as the largest solar power developer in the world by Mercom Capital, Adani said.Company’s MD&CEO Vneet S Jaain said the financial results for the quarter display the resilience of Adani Green even in scenarios like Covid-19 pandemic. “Across our plants, we have continued completely normal operations even in this pandemic situation and remain committed towards power supply being the ‘essential services’. This was also possible with our staff working diligently to meet power requirement of the country in such critical situation,” Jaain said.The construction activity continued across all the sites and has further enhanced. The company looks forward to continue its operations and construction work normally while pursuing all precautions for safety of all employees, he added.“Adani Green Energy has progressed to become the largest solar power producer in the world, having won the world’s largest solar bid of 8 GW and, with this, we have moved closer to our goal of commissioning renewable capacity of 25 GW by 2025,” Jaain further said.
The Covid-19 pandemic may have hit the sporting world hard, postponing and even cancelling many tournaments across the globe but it gave top Indian cricketers much-needed time away from cricket and allowed them to get back to full fitness. Mumbai Indians all-rounder Hardik Pandya is one of the primary ones among them.The hard-hitting all-rounder has had his fair share of injuries in the last two years, which have forced him to miss matches and even series. Hardik did prove his fitness in the DY Patil T20 cup earlier this year but the IPL 2020 opener against Chennai Super Kings on Saturday in Abu Dhabi, will be the all-rounder’s first recognised cricket match in 12 months. (Also Read: Full coverage of IPL 2020)Padya last played a T20I against South Africa in September 2019. The Mumbai Indians think tank too is aware of the workload of one of their premier all-rounders in the lead-up the 13th edition of IPL.“Hardik is coming back from an injury. So we will have to be mindful of that but he is looking very good in the nets,” Mumbai Indians head coach Mahela Jayawardene said while responding to Hindustan Times’ question during MI’s virtual media conference on Thursday.In whatever glimpse that we have got of Hardik from MI’s various social media handles, the junior Pandya does look to be in fine touch and raring to go. But unlike in Indian colours, where he has to play the role of a designated fifth bowler and at times the third seamer and also bear the bulk of the load of finishing matches with the bat, Pandya has a much different or in other words a simpler role for MI.Also Read | Rohit names three MI bowlers who can replace ‘incomparable’ Malinga“We have used him (Hardik) in different roles in the past and we will look into that. We have quite a number of other players who can fit into that role as well, so whenever the opportunity is there we ask anyone to finish the game off,” said the former Sri Lanka captain adding that finishing matches with the bat does not depend on Pandya alone.“It doesn’t just fall on Hardik but it is one of his responsibilities, so we want to try and challenge players in different ways in this camp, so we will continue to do that,” he said.Jayawardena is spot on. The presence of Kieron Pollard, Krunal Pandya and Suryakumar Yadav in MI’s batting-unit eases a lot of pressure for Pandya. He can then play his natural game of going after the bowling from ball one, which he did to perfection, scoring at a staggering strike rate of 191.12 in last IPL. He also scored 402 runs at an average of 44.66 which is by far the Baroda cricketer’s best in the five seasons that he has played in the IPL.
Updated: Sep 19, 2020 16:02 ISTAsking citizens to be cautious while being online, National Security Adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval said on Friday financial frauds have seen exponential increase due to greater dependence on digital payment platforms following the Covid-19 pandemic.He also said the Centre was coming up with the National cyber security Strategy - 2020 which envisions the safe, secured, trusted, resilient and vibrant cyberspace for India’s prosperity.WATCH | After Chinese app ban, NSA Ajit Doval speaks on new Cyber Security StrategyHe was delivering a lecture on Cyber security virtually at the COCONXIII-2020, a data privacy and hacking conference hosted by the Kerala Police and the Society for the Policing of Cyberspace and Information Security Research Association.According to him, there is a change in the work environment that has been brought upon by the pandemic.“There is a greater dependence on digital payment platform due to reduced cash handling and greater data sharing is happening online and presence on social media have also increased. While we are able to manage our affairs online to a certain extent, malicious actors also found in it, a new opportunity,” Doval said.Doval said there was an increase of 500 per cent in cyber crimes due to limited awareness and cyber hygiene.“Financial frauds have seen exponential increase due to greater dependence on digital payment platforms. The adversaries are tempted to exploit the crisis situation through various misinformation, fake news etc. The huge cyber data floating in the cyber space is a gold mine for extracting information that can undermine the privacy of our citizens..,” Doval said.He cautioned citizens while being online and said a responsible approach should be there while using internet.The NSA complimented the state government and the Kerala police for the initiative.Inaugurating the conference, Kerala Governor Arif Mohammed Khan said with the increased reliance on the internet becoming a permanent feature of people’s lives due to COVID- 19, citizens need to be extra cautious while being online.This edition of the conference was on the virtual platform this year due to the pandemic scenario .“Various types of cyber crimes are happening in our country and it’s high time that we take proper precautions against such crimes...,” Khan said.Senior police officials, including state police chief Loknath Behera, participated on the first day of the two-day conference.
The government’s decision to ease FDI norms in the defence sector will push self-reliance in production and keep national interests and security paramount, Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal said on Friday.He said that foreign investments in the defence sector would be subject to scrutiny on grounds of national security.The government has permitted 74 per cent foreign direct investment (FDI) under automatic route in the sector with certain conditions.“Now, FDI is allowed up to 74 per cent through automatic route and beyond 74 per cent to be permitted through government (approval) route. This will enhance ease of doing business and contribute to growth of investment, income and employment. In line with our collective vision of Aatmanirbhar Bharat, amendments will enhance self-reliance in defence production, while keeping national interests and security paramount,” he said in a tweet.The permit for up to 74 per cent FDI in the defence manufacturing through the automatic route was announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in May while announcing the fourth tranche of the Rs 20 lakh crore stimulus package for the coronavirus-hit economy. In July 2018, the government had relaxed foreign direct investment norms in the defence sector by allowing up to 49 per cent FDI under the automatic route. The move was aimed at boosting domestic industry as India imports about 70 per cent of its military hardware.According to the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade data, defence industries have received FDI equity inflows of USD 9.52 million (Rs 56.88 crore) during April 2000 and March 2020. Under the government route, foreign investors have to take prior approval of the respective ministry/department, while in the automatic route, the investor just has to inform the Reserve Bank of India after the investment is made.
The coronavirus pandemic has pushed the US federal budget deficit above $3 trillion for the first 11 months of fiscal 2020, more than doubling the previous full-year record, the US Treasury said on Friday.The budget deficit for August was $200 billion, matching the deficit in August 2019 and lower than the $245 billion forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll. However, $55 billion worth of benefit payments were shifted into July because August started on a weekend.The $3.007 trillion year-to-date deficit was nearly triple the $1.067 trillion deficit for the comparable year-ago period, spurred by a massive increase in government spending to battle the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.The previous 11-month deficit record was $1.37 trillion, reported by the Treasury in August 2009 during the financial crisis and recession. The full fiscal 2009 deficit totaled $1.4 trillion.The 2020 fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. September has traditionally been a budget surplus month because of quarterly corporate tax payment deadlines, but a US Treasury official said it was impossible to forecast whether a September deficit was expected this year.August budget outlays were $423 billion, compared to $428 billion in August 2019, while receipts last month were $223 billion, compared to $228 billion in the year-earlier period, the Treasury said.
The nerve agent allegedly used to poison Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was detected on an empty water bottle from his hotel room in the Siberian city of Tomsk, suggesting that he was poisoned there and not at the airport as first thought, his team said on Thursday.Navalny fell ill on a flight in Russia last month and was airlifted to Berlin for treatment. Laboratories in Germany, France and Sweden have said he was poisoned by Novichok nerve agent, a poison developed by the Soviet military. Russia denies this and says it has seen no such evidence.A video posted on Navalny’s Instagram account showed members of his team searching the room he had just left in the Xander Hotel in Tomsk on August 20, an hour after they learned he had fallen sick in suspicious circumstances.“It was decided to gather up everything that could even hypothetically be useful and hand it to the doctors in Germany,” the post said.The video of the hotel room shows two water bottles on a desk, and another on a bedside table. Navalny’s team members are seen placing items into plastic bags.“Two weeks later, a German lab found traces of Novichok on the bottle of water from the Tomsk hotel room,” the post said.Previously, Navalny’s aides had said they suspected he had been poisoned with a cup of tea he drank at Tomsk airport.

Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap recently tweeted about late actor Sushant Singh Rajput and how he ‘ghosted’ him a couple of times after agreeing to a project. The first time it happened was during Hasee Toh Phasee, which released in 2014. In a recent interview, Anurag shared more details about all that happened behind the scenes.Anurag has previously talked about how he had roped in Sushant for Hasee Toh Phasee but he went ahead and signed a three film deal with Yash Raj Films. His first film with them was Shuddh Desi Romance co-starring Parineeti Chopra. However, Anurag has now said that Parineeti earlier did not want to work with Sushant.Speaking to journalist Faye D’Souza, Anurag said, “He was supposed to do the film (Hasee Toh Phasee) and we had to find an actress and we reached out to Parineeti Chopra. She said ‘I don’t want to work with a television actor’. So we explained to her that who Sushant Singh is, he is doing Kai Po Che, he is doing PK and by the time Hasee Toh Phasee comes out, he will not just be a television actor. And she was doing a film called Shuddh Desi Romance and she must have gone and spoken to YRF, they called him and said ‘Why don’t you come and do Shuddh Desi Romance and not do that film?’ And he disappeared on us.”Anurag said that everyone understood that going with YRF was a better deal for Sushant and so not one opposed him for it. Sushant worked with Parineeti in Shuddh Desi Romance while she worked with Sidharth Malhotra in Hasee Toh Phasee.Sushant allegedly ghosted Anurag again in 2016. “Years later, in 2016, before the release of MS Dhoni: The Untold Story, Mukesh went to Sushant and said, ‘Anurag has written a script looking for an actor who can play someone based out of Uttar Pradesh.’ Dhoni released, became a success and he never called me back. I was not upset, I moved on, I did Mukkabaaz,” the filmmaker said in an interview to NDTV.Anurag also said in his interview to Faye: “Sushant Singh Rajput had six blockbusters. It would take another four years of films not working for him to written off totally. A lot of people at that time didn’t know what he was going through. It is only now that it has come out that he was dealing with depression. But the problem the industry had with him at that time was that he was ghosting people. The problem was not that he would misbehave. People who would meet him would say Sushant Singh Rajput is a great boy, who behaves very well, who is sensitive, who is nice. But he would jut ghost and disappear.”Anurag added that he knows Sushant was trying to change this part of him. He changed his agencies, moved from YRF to Corner Stone. Anurag said that Sushant’s new manager reached to him three weeks before the actor’s death, asking for work. He said that Sushant told his manager ‘If you take my name to Anurag, he won’t answer your call’. Anurag believes that Sushant was also feeling guilty for disappearing on him.
Updated: Sep 14, 2020 08:51 ISTJadavpur University has formally decided to provide android handsets and data pack to students, not having such facilities, as new semester classes are slated to begin this month, an official said on Sunday. The JU also decided to hold final semester examination in arts and science stream in contactless digital mode from October 1 to 10. JU Pro-Vice-Chancellor Chiranjib Bhattacharya told PTI on Sunday that those students not having smartphones and net connectivity will be provided with the handsets and data pack in arts, science and engineering streams very soon.Read More: Jadavpur University starts virtual classes for arts, science students“We will provide them with good quality sets compatible with net facilities, sharing, uploading and downloading options and for those needing good connectivity data pack and recharge for three months,” Bhattacharya said.He, however, said the total number of such students was being assessed by a university committee after the students’ union provided their own survey figure.Asked how the students not having android sets and poor net connectivity will get access to classes as digital classes in arts and science are slated to begin from September 14, Bhattacharya said the authorities are planning to complete the process as early as possible.Semester classes for engineering are slated to begin from September 25.Asked to elaborate on the digital mode of teaching, Bhattacharya said it will be done on a virtual platform on Google.Also, audio and video clips of lectures and course contents will be uploaded at a secure, protected dedicated section in university portal.The teachers of the concerned department will be able to access the section and share the links of files through pdf with the student having net connectivity.The students having net connectivity will share the contents with those deprived of the facilities as of now.Once they too get the facilities, everyone will be able to participate in classes and there will be no digital divide.The varsity will provide the handsets and net pack from its own fund raised from contributions from various quarters including alumni and faculty.The Pro-VC said the university on Friday decided to hold final semester exams in arts and science streams from October 1 to 10 in ‘non-contact, digital’ mode.“Questions will be sent through email before exams.Students will have to download the questions and answer on paper sheet in two hours time. After two hours they will have to mail it back through attachment,” he said.The students will be given some extra time keeping in mind net connectivity issues but that cannot be indefinitely extended.“If any student faces difficulty he can call up a helpline number given before the exams,” he said.The varsity decided to hold exams after the UGC gave nod to the state Higher education department to conduct final semester tests in October, he said.
Ajinkya Rahane is talked about as one of the most elegant batsmen we have in Indian cricket. He has been a solid presence for Team India in the middle order along with Virat Kohli. India Test vice-captain often gets his team out of trouble in overseas conditions. He has been one of the premier performers for India abroad and gained a lot of plaudits for his batting display in the series against South Africa.Rahane has scored 2962 runs in 90 matches for India at a decent average of 35.26. But despite some impressive performances in South Africa, Rahane hasn’t played limited-overs cricket for more than two years. It looked like Rahane could have been selected for the much-coveted no.4 spot in India’s squad for the 2019 World Cup. The middle-order looked brittle ahead of the showpiece event and it was thought that Rahane could have added some stability to it.One of Rahane’s mentors recently talked to Indian Express and said that the Mumbai player needs to speak up more about his position in the team.READ | Yuvraj Singh recalls his six sixes in an over, Stuart Broad reacts“It’s a mystery why he doesn’t play ODIs despite him performing whenever given chances. Sometimes, I feel he needs to speak up. He is a reserved guy who doesn’t like to argue with anyone but a time comes when one has to start asking questions. He is the vice-captain of the (Test) team and needs to show that in the dressing room by talking,” one of his mentors told The Indian Express.“He was about to get dropped for a Test match against Sri Lanka in Delhi despite being the vice-captain. He was fine with it until one of his Mumbai teammates questioned the team management about his exclusion.“He (Rahane) has given an impression that if the team management wants, they can drop him and he will take it happily. It’s good to say ‘I’m ready to make a sacrifice for the team’ but one has to understand hard reality. Public memory is short. He should have been in the World Cup team. But Rahane never questioned his omission.”Rahane will look to get back into the reckoning with an impressive display in UAE. He is going to ply his trade for Delhi Capital in IPL 2020.
Ahead of Election Commission notification for Bihar assembly election, governor Phagu Chauhan on Saturday appointed six vice-chancellors (V-Cs) and seven pro-VCs in the state universities.This happened after consultation between Chauhan and chief minister Nitish Kumar in the afternoon over the panel of names submitted by the search committee earlier this month following interaction with the short listed candidates. This time, Bihar candidates have also found favour apparently in view of elections. After a long time, a woman has also been made V-C.Pataliputra University pro-VC Girish Kumar Choudhary has been made the vice-chancellor of Patna University. Choudhary was earlier with National Institute of Technology, Patna.Prof Ajay Kumar Singh has been made the pro-VC at PU. He is professor and head, department of botany, Dr Rajendra Prasad Central Agriculture University, Pua (Samastipur).In Lalit Narayan Mithila University,Surendra Pratap Singh has been made the V-C. He is from Lucknow. In Kameshar Singh Darbhanga Sanskrit University, Prof Shashi Nath Jha has been made the V-C. Former PU P-VC Dolly Sinha has been made P-VC there.A professor of economics and senior most dean at BNMU, Prof Ram Kishor Prasad Raman has been made the V-C in his parent university.

The catwalk is now passé, what’s cool is the emergence of an intensely expressive, almost immersive experience—— the fashion film. The perfect way to have a virtual tête-à-tête to establish a disrupted reconnection with the audience.It is the most fashionable accessory, many designers have adopted internationally as well as domestically, to serenade an audience that seems jaded with a girl walking straight to the bursting of a thousand light bulbs.This year at ICW 2020, we have a melange of films they have pushed the proverbial envelope. From majestic forts juxtaposing the vivaciousness of couture to underwater renditions creating a light as air mood, as well as historical locations soaked in cultural magnificence, of the past, each designer has succeeded in capturing the true essence of couture, through the lens of a camera.With our life now in the palm of our hands almost literally and metaphorically, this medium of communication, is going to shape the tone-on-tone future of fashion. The beauty of films is, it allows an unfettered approach to themes that earlier had the limitations of a ramp. You can actually shoot at a palace, or a hotel which reeks of decadence as well as mirror the myriad emotions of a bride through a spectacular minarets which have withstood the test of time and tide.FDCI chairman Sunil Sethi.The biggest advantage is employment generation from choreographers, stylists, models to makeup artists, videographers and lensmen, everyone has found work which had depleted in the last few months.Internationally, this format has gained steam with engaging concepts. Ralph and Russo created their own version of a muse with strength, hoping to provide refuge in fantasy, while Dior offered the most beautiful version of “escapism” complete with mermaids and nymphs.As the world becomes increasingly silent, designers like Elie Saab have shown the desire to go back to nature, with reverence paving the way for quieter couture. Paris Couture Week which went digital, in keeping with a largely monochromatic existence, is reflective of the flavours of a post-pandemic existence.We hope to set a new world order with engrossing technologies, that have removed the velvet ropes democratising couture, creating a larger audience than just a 100 privileged participants dressed to the nines!
AstraZeneca Plc’s Covid-19 vaccine study remains paused in the US pending a regulatory review of an incident in which a UK participant became ill, federal officials said.The British drugmaker and its partner, the University of Oxford, put research into the shot on hold last week after the volunteer suffered neurological symptoms. Trials resumed in the UK over the weekend, while researchers in South Africa also restarted tests, saying that an independent safety committee concluded that the event was unlikely to be related to the vaccination.Temporary pauses in clinical trials aren’t unusual. However, the reported event has heightened worry that the global campaign to find a Covid-19 vaccine is moving too quickly. AstraZeneca is among several drugmakers who have agreed to work with and supply shots to Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration’s effort to expedite the development of an inoculation.Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease expert, told CNN it’s probably just a matter of time before they restart in the US Moncef Slaoui, who is leading the Warp Speed initiative, said the trial would resume when independent safety monitors and the Food and Drug Administration determine it’s safe.“This pause while the adverse event is fully investigated means the science-based, data-driven process is working as it should,” he said in a statement.FDA’s ReviewFDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said during an Instagram Live event that the agency is “going to do very significant work with the company to figure out if there’s a significant safety issue or not.”The trial went on pause worldwide last week while doctors looked into the illness of a phase 3 clinical trial participant who received the vaccine and became ill. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN Tuesday “it would be unusual to completely stop a trial on the basis of one single adverse event.”The Serum Institute of India has received Indian regulatory approval to resume local trials and intends to restart in the next day or two, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the regulator’s decision isn’t public.A representative for AstraZeneca declined to comment.Data from final-stage trials of the AstraZeneca vaccine are expected as soon as next month, and Chief Executive Officer Pascal Soriot said last week the injection could still be available by the end of the year.
Updated: Sep 19, 2020 17:05 ISTHailing the National Education Policy 2020, President Ram Nath Kovind on Saturday said that the Academic Bank of Credits is “a major shift” in policy which would be of “great help” to students.“The Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) is a major shift in policy which will be of great help to students. The ABC will digitally store the academic credits earned from various Higher Education Institutions so that degrees can be awarded, taking into account the credits earned by the students,” the President said.“It will allow students to take courses as per their vocational, professional or intellectual requirements. It will also allow them for suitable exit and re-entry points. This flexibility will be very useful for the students,” he added.He further said that the NEP 2020 document mentions nearly 20 great scientists, saint-scholars and thinkers from ancient India.“I request you all to develop study material on them and other such great ancient scholars. Their work should be rewritten in modern terminology. Verifiable and relevant learning from our rich past must be put into practice by our education system,” he urged.President Kovind pointed out that one of the targets of NEP 2020 is to increase Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education to 50 per cent by 2035 adding that technology can help in achieving this target.“The online system of education can also be utilised to reach out to international students. Technology would be particularly helpful for female students and other students from the weaker sections who find it physically difficult to access education facilities,” he added.The President further said that the greater use of online facilities will also help overcome problems of shortage of faculty and other resources. “Educational institutions should develop very good portals and apps to provide e-learning, e-library and other digital facilities.”He pointed out that “One of the most important features” in the NEP is equity and inclusion.“One of the most important features of the National Education Policy is its focus on equity and inclusion. In this context, I am glad to note that according to the All India Survey of Higher Education for 2018-19, GER for females is slightly higher than that for males, he said.Highlighting that the share of female students “is extremely low” in institutions and said that this “needs to be corrected.”“The higher education ecosystem should reflect concern for gender justice in terms of enrolment and contribution, especially in technical institutions,” he added.Earlier, President Kovind said that the effective implementation of the National Education Policy 2020 would help India to regain its glory as a great centre of learning.

It wasn’t much of a surprise when noted former cricketers picked Mumbai Indians as a certainty to make the play-offs of IPL 2020. After all, there haven’t been too many seasons where the four-time champions – the most – have disappointed. The defending champions will once again start as favourites to lift the trophy when they take on Chennai Super Kings in the tournament opener on Saturday in Abu Dhabi.Also Follow | IPL 2020 Full CoverageLike CSK, who are missing the services of Suresh Raina and Harbhajan Singh, MI too are without their most trusted weapon with the ball – Sri Lanka legend Lasith Malinga. In his absence, how will MI find the perfect balance? Let’s find out by predicting MI’s Playing XI for the first match.Also Read | CSK Predicted XI: Who would replace Suresh Raina?1. Rohit Sharma: Rohit confirmed that he will open the batting throughout the season just like last year. The India vice-captain has led MI to four titles and is the third highest run-scorer in the history of the IPL. Rohit blew hot and cold last season, but despite that he managed to score kore than 400 runs. He is a man in form this year and will look to lead by example.2. Quinton de Kock: MI head coach Mahela Jayawardena stated that South Africa T20I captain Quinton de Kock will partner Rohit Sharma at the top. The left-handed wicket-keeper batsman was sold to Mumbai by Royal Challengers Bangalore in IPL 2019’s first trade and he will look to add plenty of depth and panache at the top of the order. De Kock had a reasonably good outing last season and is in great form this year which bodes well for Mumbai Indians.Also Read | Four players that raise their game in MI vs CSK rivalry3. Suryakumar Yadav: He has been one of the top performers for Mumbai in the domestic circuit and showed his class with India A in New Zealand earlier this year. A good season here and Yadav could force his way to the Indian side for the limited-overs fixtures and who knows, perhaps even the T20 World Cup.4. Ishan Kishan: With MS Dhoni now retired, this IPL will be very important for young wicket-keeper batsman Ishan Kishan. He has shown the ability and pedigree to be successful under extreme pressure and all he needs now is to maintain consistency.5. Kieron Pollard: Over the years, Windies all-rounder Kieron Pollard has been instrumental in MI reaching astronomical heights. But the veteran is now on a downward curve and had a rather unfamiliar outing last time around. Pollard will be eager to change his fortunes for the good this season.6. Hardik Pandya: He is slowly hitting his stride after a long injury lay-off and a fit and firing Hardik Pandya will add tremendous depth to this Mumbai Indians outfit. That MI coach Jayawardena stated that the job of finishing matches won’t only be Hardik’s responsibility will allow the all-rounder to bat more freely this year.7. Krunal Pandya: The senior Pandya did not have a productive last year. From being one of the regulars in the Indian T20 side, he lost his place due to lack of impactful performances. He will look to make a case for himself by producing strong performances.8. Mitchell McClenaghan: New Zealand pacer Mitchell McClenaghan is almost guaranteed of a place in the side considering what he brings to the table – aggression and experience.9. Rahul Chahar: The leg-spinner emerged as MI’s frontline spinner last season after dethroning Mayank Markande. He is set to play a key role on UAE pitches which are known to assist the spinners.10. Jasprit Bumrah: Bumrah is a force to reckon with in the shortest format and will lead Mumbai’s pace attack once again this season. But this time, there will be added pressure in the absence of Malinga.11. Trent Boult: One of the most valuable additions to the MI squad this year is New Zealand pace spearhead Trent Boult. He is one of the most lethal bowlers going around in world cricket with the new ball and together with Bumrah and NZ teammate McClenaghan, he promises to be part of a formidable pace trio.
It is now obvious that the moves by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in eastern Ladakh this summer were premeditated, planned and smoothly executed. This comes through when you consider the strength of the troops involved as well as the multiple locations where action has been seen. There were certain military objectives set out for PLA and at least some, if not all, of those have been achieved. In the process, China has violated many of the agreements with India on the maintenance of peace and tranquillity on the border. Having done so, China has indicated that it is neither going to vacate its military aggression nor restore the status quo ante. Several rounds of diplomatic as well as military negotiations aimed at de-escalating the situation in the western sector of the India-China border have proved this.From the statements of Chinese diplomatic envoys as well as other interlocutors, with whom this writer has had the opportunity to interact virtually, China’s diplomatic game plan is also becoming apparent. Having accomplished much that it had planned militarily on the ground, China intends to make these positions permanent and amass the gains. Simultaneously, it will do all it can to ensure that the rest of the India-China relationship continues its normal course and that it is business-as-usual in economic relations, in people-to-people exchanges and in multilateral engagements. That is its game plan. Chinese diplomacy fully intends and hopes to reach this goal. If it is allowed to do so, it will truly be a win-win for China.If China accomplishes this diplomatic objective vis-à-vis India, it will be able to show the world that India has accepted the new military realities on the ground in Ladakh. By extension, other countries should not worry about the implications of China’s moves on its border with India and about aggressive Chinese behaviour. It will also cement China’s pre-eminent position in the Asian pecking order.Incidentally, this has also been China’s playbook in the South China Sea and has been pursued with finesse and success there. It is only now that the United States (US) is beginning to challenge such obviously unacceptable actions, even as countries in the region continue to be diplomatically bogged down with negotiating a code of conduct while China merrily continues with its armed military aggression.A further implication for India if it were to quietly acquiesce in this Chinese game plan is that there will be nothing to stop PLA from repeating its actions later this year, or next year or the next. This will merely be in line with Chinese activities elsewhere. We must be clear-headed and practical to see through Beijing’s military-diplomatic manoeuvres.Former Chinese ambassadors, retired PLA officers as well as international relations experts that I have had occasion to interact with, repeatedly stated that China does not view India as a strategic enemy. Hence, the argument goes, the rest of the India-China relationship should be normalised as soon as possible, particularly as this is the 70th anniversary year of the establishment of diplomatic ties. In response, when they were told that if this was indeed the case, then China should find it easy to restore the status quo ante in Ladakh, there was stony silence from them.For all these reasons, it is of utmost importance for India to send a clear message to China, that we view PLA’s actions in Ladakh as a serious test for the relationship. The tactical inference that India has drawn is that China desires to unilaterally decide where the Line of Actual Control (LAC) lies. The strategic implication is that China is clearly exhibiting that it is the regional hegemon in Asia, that it can do as it pleases in its neighbourhood, and that the 21st century is not an Asian century but solely a Chinese century.Through the military action in Ladakh, where the Indian Army fought bravely and heroically, New Delhi has conveyed that it does not accept any of these propositions and that it shall stand up to Chinese bullying. Now, New Delhi needs to ensure that China’s diplomatic playbook does not succeed. India-China relations cannot be business-as-usual. The ban on Chinese mobile phone apps, changes in public procurement policies aimed at weeding out Chinese companies, and an added level of scrutiny in India’s investment apparatus are all good first steps.While China is worried, especially because India’s actions have had a snowballing effect, for example, in the ban on TikTok, it still appears that our message has not been heard loud and clear in Beijing. If peace cannot prevail in the India-China border areas, then the rest of the relationship cannot continue as before. India-China relations will be negatively impacted.Therefore, New Delhi needs to reinforce this clear-cut position by taking some more steps and measures to amply clarify the revised Indian policy toward China. One of the loudest signals that we can send is to ban Chinese firms from India’s 5G trials and roll-out. New Delhi needs to announce this decision soon.Gautam Bambawale is a former Indian ambassador to China and high commissioner to Pakistan.

Democratic nominee Joe Biden has no plans to release a list of potential Supreme Court nominees, a campaign official said Saturday.Biden had come under pressure after the Friday death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to publish a list of people he might pick for the high court vacancy given the opportunity. The former vice president has only committed to nominating a Black woman to the court if he faced a vacancy as president.President Donald Trump said Saturday he expects to nominate a replacement for Ginsburg next week and it would likely be a woman. He complimented two appeals court judges said to be on his short list, Amy Coney Barrett and Barbara Lagoa.Biden said late Friday that whoever wins the November 3rd election should be the one to fill the vacancy left by Ginsburg, while most Republicans have insisted the decision is up to Trump.Trump had released a list of potential nominees even before Ginsburg’s death, seeking to distract from campaign-season criticism over his response to the coronavirus pandemic.Just before Ginsburg’s death was announced, Biden was asked about naming potential Cabinet officials or justices before the election.“We’re going through that now with the transition committee of the people who I might choose,” Biden told reporters after a campaign stop in Duluth, Minnesota on Friday. “There’s a lot of incredibly qualified people. What I want to make sure I do is keep the commitment that my government, assuming I win, my Cabinet and the White House looks like the country.”When pressured into whether he would release any names before the election, Biden said, “No, I don’t think so.”
China claimed on Wednesday that it has been honouring agreements signed with India and is committed to maintaining peace in border areas, a day after defence minister Rajnath Singh said Beijing is not respecting the customary alignment of the boundary.Singh had told Parliament that China has engaged in massive mobilisation of troops at the Line of Actual Control (LAC), engaged in aggressive behaviour, and sought to unilaterally change the status quo, in contravention of existing border agreements and pacts.Responding to Singh’s statement, the Chinese foreign ministry again blamed New Delhi for the tensions, saying it is India which has breached agreements made to maintain tranquility along the disputed boundary.“For the Chinese side, we have been honouring the agreements signed between China and India. We are committed to peace and stability in the border area,” foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said when asked to comment on Singh’s statement.“We are committed to our sovereignty and territorial integrity. But China is not to blame for the current situation. It is the Indian side that has breached the agreements, first trespassed the territory first and fired shots to threaten the safety of the Chinese border troops first,” Wang said at the regular ministry briefing.“So, what is imperative is for the Indian side to address these mistakes to follow through the disengagement agreements and take concrete actions to ease up the situation on the ground,” Wang said, repeating Beijing’s stand on the months-long border standoff that’s plunged bilateral ties to the worst level in decades.India has already dismissed similar allegations made by China earlier, saying the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) troops were the first to provoke and not ready to disengage.External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava clearly spelt out the Indian government’s position on the disengagement process earlier, saying the LAC “must be strictly respected and observed as this is the basis for peace and tranquility in the border areas.”“During the Moscow meeting the two foreign Ministers reached five point agreements on the border situation,” spokesperson Wang said, referring to the recent meeting between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation meeting of foreign ministers in Moscow.“We hope India will work with China to follow through on the agreement and also other previously reached agreements and put the border issue at an appropriate position in the bigger picture of China India relations,” he said.Wang added that China is ready to work with India to remain in dialogue and consultation through diplomatic channels, jointly ensure peace and tranquility of the border areas.
HSBC Holdings Plc slumped below its financial crisis closing low set more than a decade ago as pressures mount on several fronts, including political tension in Hong Kong, the fallout of the pandemic and renewed Brexit turmoil in the UKThe London-based bank’s UK shares on Friday slid below their closing low for March 2009, hitting 304p, as they extended this year’s plunge to almost 49%. This marks HSBC’s lowest closing price in London since 1998.Europe’s largest bank has been caught in a maelstrom of trouble over the past year amid unrest in its biggest market, Hong Kong. It also faces difficulties in navigating low interest rates and surging loan losses sparked by the global pandemic.The fall in HSBC stock echoed a decline across London-listed banking shares. The FTSE 350 Banks index hit its lowest intraday level in almost 28 years as domestically-focused lenders including Barclays Plc, Lloyds Banking Group Plc and NatWest Group Plc all fell. These firms are facing the renewed prospect of a no-deal Brexit, threatening to push rates even lower amid the worst recession in centuries.HSBC Chief Executive Officer Noel Quinn, who took over as the bank’s permanent head in March, last month issued a stark warning about tough times ahead while reporting that first-half profit halved and predicting loan losses could swell to $13 billion this year. Quinn said the bank would attempt to hasten a shakeup of its global operations, accelerating a further pivot into Asia as its European operations lose money.Struggling to boost returns, the lender has come under fire both in the West and in China as it attempts to steer through political tension. HSBC was lambasted in the U.S. and the UK over its support for China’s new security legislation on Hong Kong, while state-backed Chinese media has voiced displeasure over the lender’s role in an American investigation of Huawei Technologies Co.A jump in income from its markets business has failed to make up for broader shortcomings, unlike at some Wall Street and European competitors. HSBC stock has fallen more steeply than most big rivals this year, with Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. posting declines of 43% and 29%, respectively.To make matters worse, HSBC sparked anger in Hong Kong earlier this year, alienating some of its most loyal investors, after scrapping its dividend in response to the pandemic. The bank is the worst performer on the benchmark Hang Seng index so far this year.
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) on Tuesday projected the Indian economy to contract 9% this fiscal, deeper than its June estimate of 4%, saying the fast-spreading coronavirus is hindering economic activity and consumer sentiment.The multilateral bank, however, expects GDP to rebound next fiscal with an 8% growth.ADB’s move follows rating agency S&P Global Ratings on Monday forecasting a 9% contraction in the Indian economy in FY21. Fitch Ratings and Moody’s Investors Service have also lowered their estimates for FY21 to a contraction of 14.8% and 11.5%, respectively, while investment bank Goldman Sachs has forecast GDP to shrink by 10.5% this fiscal.“India imposed strict lockdown measures to contain the spread of the pandemic, and this has had a severe impact on economic activity,” ADB chief economist Yasuyuki Sawada said in a statement.“It is crucial that containment measures such as robust testing, tracking, and ensuring treatment capacities, are implemented consistently and effectively.”In its latest update to Asian Development Outlook, ADB said India’s growth outlook remains highly vulnerable to either a prolonged outbreak or a resurgence of Covid-19 cases. “Other downside risks include increasing public and private debt levels that could affect technology and infrastructure investment, as well as rising non-performing loans ...that could further weaken the financial sector and its ability to support growth,” it said.The Manila-based bank said steps taken by the Indian government to address the pandemic, including a rural employment guarantee programme and other social protection measures, will aid rural incomes protecting the vulnerable people, but private consumption may continue to suffer.
Sussanne Khan has shared a powerful picture on Instagram and ex-husband Hrithik Roshan couldn’t stop praising the perfect frame. The interior designer shared the picture with the lyrics of Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark’s song, If You Leave.Sharing the picture, she wrote, “If you leave I won’t cry... I won’t waste a single day.. #neverlookback #eaglesnestwarmth.” She is seen in purple pants and indigo blazer paired with high heels and a shoulder-length hairstyle. The picture shows her side profile as she sits on a chair, besides the statue of a man with the face of an eagle.Hrithik reacted to the post, saying, “Super pic,” to which Sussanne replied, “@hrithikroshan was trying to do ‘the look away look’!” with a laughing emoji. Sussanne’s sister Farah Khan Ali also commented, “Love it Suss.” Rohit Roy also wrote in the comments section, “Awesome!!!”Hrithik and Sussanne continue to co-parent their sons Hrehaan and Hridhaan, and had even spent the lockdown together at his home to ensure they are their for their children. Sussanne has also been a part of the Ganpati celebrations at Hrithik’s house and the many birthdays they celebrated in the last few months.Applauding her decision to move to his residence during lockdown to co-parent their sons, Hrithik had written on his Instagram account, “It is heartwarming to see the world come together as one in this time of deep uncertainty and possibility of months of social distancing and potential lockdowns for several weeks perhaps. While the world talks about humanity coming together, I think it represents more than just an idea especially for parents sharing custody of their kids. How to keep their kids close to them without infringing on the right of the other who also has an equal right to be with his/her children.”Sussanne Khan at Hrithik Roshan’s house during lockdown.Sharing a picture of Sussanne sitting in his living room, Hrithik had further written, “This is a picture of dear Sussanne (my ex wife) , who has graciously volunteered to temporarily move out of her home so that our children are not disconnected indefinitely from either one of us. Thank you Sussanne for being so supportive and understanding in our journey of co-parenting. Our children will tell the story we create for them. I hope and pray that in order to safeguard the health of ourselves and our loved ones, we all find our way to express love, empathy, courage, strength with an open heart.”
Updated: Sep 16, 2020 15:00 ISTThe possibility of home exams being compromised or manipulated by participants or coaching centres cannot be ruled out, the Delhi High Court has said while dismissing a plea that candidates be allowed to take Common Law Admission Test (CLAT) 2020 from their homes instead of exams centres due to the COVID-19 pandemic.The court said the problem of accessibility for 78,000 candidates to appropriate technology, internet connection, laptop or desktop computer would be doubtful and the plea for home exam cannot be accepted.The CLAT-2020 examination, to be held on August 22 earlier, will now be conducted on September 28.Justice Jayant Nath said it is clear that the pleas of the petitioner are misplaced and cannot be a ground for postponing the exams or change of mode to conduct the exam.“I may also note that the petitioner (V Govinda Ramanan) has completed his LLB in 2016. It is now after a gap of 4 years that he seeks to apply for a post graduation in law. The petitioner has hence waited for four years to give the exam. There is no merit in the present petition. The same is dismissed,” the judge said.While the order was passed on September 10, it was made available on the court website on Wednesday.The petition was filed by the petitioner seeking an appropriate direction to quash the CLAT- 2020 examination notification issued by the Consortium of National Law Universities (NLU) in so far as it mandates the petitioner to physically go to the examination centre and give the exam.CLAT is a centralised exam for admissions to bachelors and masters courses in law in 22 NLUs in the country and is conducted by the consortium.Under the CLAT 2020 notification, the exam would be held online at notified centres where computers would be set up for candidates to access the test.The petitioner, who is a law graduate and wishes to pursue his LLM, said he suffered from asthma and falls under the vulnerable category of individuals who are advised by the government not to go outside in the present time of COVID-19 pandemic.The consortium told the court that the decision to conduct CLAT-2020 at physical test centres was challenged by way of Public Interest Litigation before the Supreme Court which has dismissed it.The high court said, “Keeping in view the aforesaid, it is clear that the aforesaid order (of Supreme Court) would remain binding on this court.” “Even otherwise, it is clear that the plea of respondent no.1 (consortium) that a home-based exam may not be appropriate for approximately 78,000 candidates who are to take the exam. The possibility of the exams being compromised or manipulated by the participants/coaching centers cannot be ruled out.“That apart, the problem of accessibility for 78,000 candidates to appropriate technology, internet connection, laptop or desktop computer itself would be doubtful. Hence this plea of the petitioner cannot be accepted.” the high court said.
By October or November, Moderna will, on the basis of an ongoing study of tens of thousands of people, decide whether its vaccine is safe and effective – with the only thing holding it back at this time being the fewer infections the US is seeing (the study is comparing rates of infection in vaccinated and unvaccinated people). The company’s chief executive Stephane Bancel, who said this in an interview to The Wall Street Journal, added that if the results are positive, Moderna could seek emergency authorisation for its vaccine from the FDA. Interestingly, Bancel’s estimate seems aggressive, even when compared to details in the 135 page-long protocol his company released on Thursday on the clinical testing of its vaccine. The protocol also contained a timeline, which differed from Bancel’s own estimates; it expects initial data to become available for analysis only in December, and the final study (not the Year 2 study) to be ready only by the middle of next year.Pfizer, which is developing a vaccine with BioNTech, is also testing it on tens of thousands of people, and it too expects initial data to come in by late October. In an interview to The Washington Post, Pfizer’s CEO Albert Bourla dramatically said that in October “the truth will be revealed”. On Thursday, Pfizer too released a detailed note on the protocol being followed in its clinical tests.The world is pinning its hopes on a vaccine. Sure, cases are down in the US and Brazil, two of the top three countries in terms of case count (both have seen a slight spike upwards in the past week, though), but they continue to rise in India (which is #2 in terms of cases). Worse, Europe is seeing a roaring second wave. France’s current seven-day average of new daily cases, at around 8,800 according to the New York Times database, is twice that seen in the peak of its first wave (in early April). Things aren’t as bad in the UK, although they are still worse than they were through much of the past three months. Daily new cases, at a seven-day average of around 3,400 cases, are at levels not seen since mid-May. The situation in Spain is as bad as in France, though – a seven-day average of almost 10,000 new cases a day, around 2,000 more than the peak of the first wave (in early April). Germany and Italy are better off, although both are seeing a second wave (Germany is where it was in late April; Italy, early May).Hardly any country, not the US, not France, and not even India, is talking about lockdowns though. It’s almost as if they were one-time-use-only weapons (and the jury is out on whether the timing of their use was right). Now everyone is talking about living with the virus – something that’s possible with strict adherence to the wearing of masks and social distancing. It’s probably the main reason cases are continuing to rise in India. If everyone wore masks outside their homes, and practised strict social distancing and hand hygiene, the number of daily cases in the country would drop drastically in perhaps the next four to five weeks. By how much? My guess (and it is that, not a scientific assessment; but remember, this is Dispatch 162) is to between a fifth and a tenth of the current number of daily new cases.And, of course, a vaccine is the perfect solution.India’s health minister Harsh Vardhan told Parliament on Thursday that a vaccine may be available by early next year, although he caveated that one may not be available in large-enough quantities immediately, and that people should continue to wear masks, follow social distancing rules, and wash their hands often. His estimate on vaccine availability is similar to the one offered by Robert R Redfield, the head of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, who said this week that he expects a vaccine to be widely available only by the middle of 2021. In late July, White House coronavirus adviser Dr Anthony Fauci offered a similar timeline – that a vaccine won’t be widely available till “several months” into 2021.It has always been clear that a vaccine for Covid-19 will be found. Dispatch 111 on July 22 cited research, and indulged in a bit of extrapolation, to arrive at a 50% probability that a vaccine candidate in Phase 2/3 trials will be found efficacious and safe. There are now 18 candidates in Phase 2 trials; six in Phase 3; and five approved for emergency or limited use (according to HT’s vaccine tracker).The challenge has always been wide availability. And it could take till late 2021, perhaps early 2022, for at least half of India’s population to be vaccinated.
The second song from the soundtrack of the upcoming film Khaali Peeli, Tehas Nehas, has been released. The video features lead stars Ishaan Khatter and Ananya Pandey dancing in a garage. Shortly after its release, the video began attracting noticeably unfavourable reactions, with the dislikes eclipsing the likes by a wide margin.Composed and produced by Vishal-Shekhar, the song has been written by Kumaar, and features vocals by Shekhar and Prakriti Kakar. The video shows Ishaan and Ananya’s characters grooving together, with several taxicabs parked around them. They appear to be inside a garage, but one without a roof, because towards the end of the video, it starts raining.Previously, the first song from the film -- Beyonce Sharma Jayegi -- was roundly criticised online for racist undertones. The lyrics of the song, written by Kumaar and Raj Shekhar, appeared to suggest that Beyonce -- a Black woman -- would be stunned if confronted by a fair-skinned woman. A few days later, the song’s title was changed to Beyonse Sharma Jayegi.Director Maqbool Khan had commented on the controversy. “First, without any hesitation or excuses we want to apologise to anyone offended. We assure you that the lyric in question was never intended racially. In fact, the term ‘goriya’ has been so often and traditionally used in Indian songs to address a girl, that it didn’t occur to any of us to interpret it in the literal manner,” he said in a statement. Kumaar added, “Goriya as a word has been used in many Hindi songs earlier. Our idea was to simply use a synonym to ‘girl’. There is no derogation intended - we revere beauty of global celebrity Beyoncé and don’t mean to hurt any of her fans.”Khaali Peeli is slated for a pay-per-view release on the newly launched Zee Plex service, which will premiere the movie on October 2 on multiple platforms, at a cost.
As Sanjay Dutt battles lung cancer, his wife Maanayata Dutt shared a motivating post on fighting fears. She shared a throwback picture of herself outdoors, along with an inspiring caption about the fight-or-flight response to fear.“Fear has two meanings: Forget Everything And Run or Face Everything And Rise....the choice is yours! #fightyourfears #riseandshine #selfbelief #throwback #love #grace #positivity #dutts #challenging yet #beautifullife #thankyougod,” she wrote. Her hashtags clearly indicate that she believes in fighting fears in order to ‘rise and shine’.Last month, Sanjay was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer. However, he has not yet given an official statement on his diagnosis. Maanayata, without sharing details of his ailment, said in a statement, “I thank everyone who has expressed their well wishes for Sanju’s speedy recovery. We need all the strength and prayers to overcome this phase. There is a lot that the family has gone through in the past years but I am confident, this too shall pass.”Maanayata urged people not to be taken in by speculation and said, “Sanju has always been a fighter, and so has our family. God has yet again chosen to test us to overcome the challenges ahead. All we seek is your prayers and blessings, and we know we will emerge as winners on the other side, as we always have. Let us use this opportunity to spread light and positivity.”Rumours were rife that Sanjay and his family would fly to the US for his treatment, but Maanayata clarified that any travel plans will only be decided as per the developments in his health.“For those asking, Sanju will complete his preliminary treatment in Mumbai. We will formulate further plans of travel depending on how and when the Covid situation eases. As of now, Sanju is in the best hands of our esteemed doctors at Kokilaben hospital. I request everyone, with my folded hands, to stop speculating the stage of his illness and let the doctors continue to do their work. We will update you all regularly with his progress,” he said.Sanjay was last seen in Mahesh Bhatt’s Sadak 2, alongside Alia Bhatt, Aditya Roy Kapur and Pooja Bhatt. He has a number of projects in the pipeline, including Bhuj: The Pride of India, Torbaaz, KGF: Chapter 2, Shamshera and Prithviraj.
Oil rose for a second day on Wednesday, gaining more than 2%, as a hurricane closed US offshore oil and gas production and an industry report showed US crude inventories decreased.More than a quarter of US offshore output was shut on Tuesday due to Hurricane Sally. The American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday said crude inventories fell 9.5 million barrels, rather than increased as analysts expected.Brent crude rose 77 cents, or 1.9%, to $41.30 a barrel by 0755 GMT, while US crude added 85 cents, or 2.2%, to $39.13. Both contracts rose by more than 2% on Tuesday.“Overnight, the API provided a further injection of bullish impetus,” said Stephen Brennock of oil broker PVM. “As much as a feel-good factor appears to have returned to the oil market, underlying fundamentals remain far from supportive.”The storm-related shutdowns may help reduce stockpiles although refineries were also closed, cutting demand. Official Energy Information Administration stocks data, which does not always confirm the API figures, is due at 1430 GMT.Oil prices collapsed to historic lows as the coronavirus crisis hit demand. A record supply cut by OPEC and its allies, known as OPEC+, and an easing of lockdowns has helped Brent recover from a 21-year low below $16 in April.Prices have dropped in September, pressured by rising virus cases and concerns about demand. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and International Energy Agency have both cut their demand outlooks this week.A panel of OPEC+ oil ministers meets to review the supply pact on Thursday and is unlikely to recommend further output curbs despite the price drop, sources told Reuters.
Less than a week after the University of Mumbai released a circular confirming the dates, method and format for end-of-term final year summer 2020 examinations, the varsity released another circular on Monday morning clarifying queries raised by affiliated colleges. With several colleges still grappling with multiple choice question (MCQ) format and ensuring all students are able to appear for exams online, the MU circular emphasises on the role of a cluster or lead college.“The concept of a lead or cluster college is to bring together a group of affiliated colleges in a given geographical region offering similar programs (arts, commerce, science, engineering, pharmacy, etc) and facilitate the synchronisation and coordination with respect to execution of various academic and examination work,” states the MU circular signed by the controller of examination, Vinod Patil. The university has also once again clarified that all exams and said MCQs will be based on what was taught in colleges until March 13, 2020, only. However, for those appearing for backlog exams (repeater candidates) the exam will be based on the complete portion.Lead colleges have also been given the responsibility of coordinating with all colleges that form the cluster and encourage involvement of teachers of all colleges for a particular subject to put together their MCQs to formulate a comprehensive bank of questions. “Inter-cluster support in order to facilitate preparation of a large base of MCQs will also be encouraged,” states the circular. Colleges have also been requested to keep in mind the level of difficulty while framing questions for the upcoming exams.“MCQ papers will comprise of 25-40 questions, to be chosen as per the requirement of the subject, and this one hour paper will carry maximum 50 marks,” states the circular and further explains how to put together the questions and four options per question. “Sample MCQs should eb prepared and provided to develop the understanding about exam pattern for students and mock tests too should be conducted for the purpose of practice.”While colleges are still grappling with the new examination format, an association representing non-government colleges has approached MU vice chancellor Suhas Pednekar requesting that all autonomous colleges and Institutes under the two cluster universities approved by state government be put together under one cluster for the purpose of better functioning. “Autonomous institutes working together will work better and they will too follow all MU guidelines for examinations,” said T Shiware, chairman of the Mumbai Association of Non-Government Colleges.Teachers, however, are not pleased with the compulsion initiated by the university on a question bank of MCQs for every subject. “We have been asked to put together a question bank of 250 questions for every subject, and I alone teach four subjects across two departments so the total workload is immense for the time we have in hand before exams for repeater candidates begins,” said a professor of a suburban college on condition of anonymity. Some teachers are also suggesting that colleges under each cluster should divide work on every subject and then put together the MCQ question bank in order to avoid repetition of questions.As per the MU schedule, practical exams for repeater candidates will begin on September 15 whereas their theory exam will start from September 25. Exams for fresh candidates will take place between October 1 and 15, 2020.
When it comes to IPL rivalries, nothing tops the one shared by Mumbai Indians and Chennai Super Kings. The two most successful IPL franchises have made for some wonderful one-on-one contests from the very first edition of the IPL 12 years ago. MI and CSK have headlined the IPL final on three different occasions with MI leading their rivals 2-1. The two teams boast some of the biggest T20 stars and even though three of them – Suresh Raina, Harbhajan Singh and Lasith Malinga – will be missing this year’s edition, expect no shortage of excitement when they lock horns in the UAE.Also Follow | IPL 2020 Full CoverageAhead of the tournament opener on Saturday, here’s an in-depth look at their rivalry over the years.Head-to-head recordMI and CSK have faced each other 28 times in the IPL with MI leading the way with 17 wins, while CSK have won 11 times. As a result of it, MI have enjoyed a higher win percentage of 60.71, as compared to CSK. However, now we come to a bigger trivia which highlights just how dominant MI have been over CSK in the recent past. In their last five encounters, MI have taken an unprecedented 5-0 lead registering wins in all matches of IPL 2019 and Match No 27 of IPL 2018. No other active team has a win percentage of more than 40 against CSK other than MI.Also Read | Five big records that could be made this seasonRohit, Raina the most prolific batsmenMI and CSK have always brought the best out of each other and this can be gauged by the fact that two of the most supreme players of the two franchises have been among runs whenever facing each other. MI captain Rohit Sharma is MI’s leading run-scorer against CSK, amassing 614 runs. As far as CSK are concerned, Raina has been burning up the charts, tallying 704 runs. With Raina out, all eyes will be on Dhoni, who is not behind with 663 runs to his name. In fact, Dhoni’s tally against Mumbai Indians is the third most against the team in IPL after Raina and Shikhar Dhawan.Also Read | ‘I was scared by the power of his shot’: Brad Hogg recalls being intimidated by Mumbai Indians batsmanCaribbean CalypsoWith 31 wickets, Lasith Malinga is MI’s highest wicket-taker against Chennai. The second on the list is Pollard who has taken 12 CSK wickets. His West Indies teammate Dwayne Bravo with 25 wickets is CSK’s leading wicket-taker against MI.Best bowling figuresHarbhajan may be part of CSK now, but for years, the veteran off-spinner was with MI. His figures of 5/18 against CSK in the 2011 edition remains the best individual bowling figures by a player in MI-CSK matches. India quick Mohit Sharma’s 4/14 in IPL 2014 remains the best figures by a CSK bowler against MIHighest individual scoresThe Matara Mauler, Sanath Jayasuriya lit up the very first edition of the IPL, scoring 114, whereas Michael Hussey’s unbeaten 86 during his fabulous 2013 season remains CSK’s highest individual score. From the current squad, Rohit’s 87 in 2011 and Shane Watson’s 80 during last year’s final remains MI’s and CSK’s respective highest scores by an individual.Individual records awaitAll-rounder Ravindra Jadeja and fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah have individual feats awaiting them in IPL 2020. CSK all-rounder Jadeja is 73 runs away from becoming the first IPL player with over 100 wickets and 2000 runs, while Bumrah will become the first Indian pacer to reach 200 wickets in T20s if he can pick 18 this season. Also, Dhoni, with 190 matches, is four games away from surpassing Raina (193) as the most capped IPL player. MI captain Rohit is 102 runs away from completing 5000 runs in IPL. He will join Virat Kohli and Raina in the list and the first from MI to break the 5K barrier.
The Union textile ministry recently abolished the All India Handicrafts Board, Handloom Board and the Power Loom Board in consonance with the government’s vision of minimum government, maximum governance. The ministry also changed the status of the eight Textile Research Associations to “approved bodies”, instead of the earlier “affiliated bodies”. Thereafter, the government withdrew the officials of the ministry of textiles from the governing bodies of these textile associations.This is a bold step in achieving leaner government machinery and to introduce systematic rationalisation of government bodies. The intention to review the “other” government organisations has been evident for quite some time. In the 2016 Union Budget speech, then finance minister Arun Jaitley announced that a task force has been constituted for rationalisation of human resources in various ministries. He also contemplated a comprehensive review and rationalisation of autonomous bodies.Ministries and departments frame policies and ensure their implementation. They are supported by a number of organisations such as autonomous bodies, statutory bodies, subordinate and attached offices, and affiliated organisations, etc. Their mode of establishment and funding, and functional autonomy differs.Autonomous bodies (ABs) are a major stakeholder in the government’s functioning as they are engaged in diverse activities, ranging from formulating frameworks for policies, conducting research, and preserving the cultural heritage, etc. Institutes imparting technical, medical and higher education fall in this category. Most of the ABs receive money from the Central Government by way of grants-in-aid (GIA). Since 2016-17, the Union budget accounts for the GIA figures to ABs separately. As per statement no. 24, 2017-18 (revised estimates), the amount disbursed to autonomous/grantee bodies was Rs 799.55 billion, which, in 2019-20, was increased to Rs 943.84 billion.These ABs employ a sizeable number of people as well. The apex administrative body of ABs is called governing council or governing body and is chaired by the minister or the secretary of the respective ministry. Besides, the ABs have specialised committees such as the purchase committee, works committee, finance committee, with nominated ministry officials. These ABs are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), and the annual report is presented in the Parliament every year.Despite a laid out administrative structure in ABs, there are a number of governance issues that needs review. On one side of the debate are proponents who believe that since these bodies are funded by taxpayer’s money, they should follow the policies of the government and be accountable the way the government departments are. Others claim that they being “autonomous” have the right to make their own financial and administrative policies. Obviously the stronger side wins, as autonomous bodies are not clearly defined. To compound matters, the exact count of ABs is not known, with estimates ranging from 400 to 650 plus. Then, ABs employ a considerable number. For example, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, an AB under the ministry of agriculture, has almost 17,000 employees.However, unlike the government and the public sector undertakings, in which the recruitment rules are uniform and the recruitment is done by a centralised body such as the Staff Selection Committee (SSC), the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), and the Public Enterprise Selection Board, there is no such body for CAB recruitments. As a result, the mode of recruitment and recruitment rules differs for each of these bodies, sometimes even across ABs within the same ministry. Finally, there is an accountability issue. Even though the senior ministry officials are required to attend ABs’ committee meetings, they mostly don’t due to their busy schedules. They nominate junior officials who often lack the jurisdiction to take meaningful decisions during the meetings. As regards audits, some ABs are audited by CAG whereas many are done by chartered accountants.There is, thus, an urgent need to review the governance of ABs, and devise uniform procedures. First, a legal framework to describe an AB should be drawn up, which defines the boundaries of its working, its autonomy, and the various policies that it must follow. This will simultaneously help identify the numbers. Based on a laid-out framework, each ministry will need to undertake a comprehensive review of ABs under their jurisdiction. ABs that have outlived the cause for which they were established may need to be closed or merged with a similar organisation or their memorandum altered as per the new charter.There are others who have changed course over time. The Centre for Cultural Resources and Training, for example, works in the field of art education of teachers and is under the ministry of culture, whereas integrating art education in school-learning is the primary domain of the education department (earlier the ministry of human resource development).Second, in order to bring about uniformity in the policies, a task force needs to be set up under a pan-Indian agency such as SSC or UPSC to streamline the recruitment rules, salary structure, allowance and perks paid to employees, and mode of recruitment.Third, to ensure the participation of ministry officials, committee meetings of similar ABs should be held together so that the appropriate authorities could provide meaningful suggestions. It is also alleged that most of the agenda items raised by ABs are routine in nature. This should be discouraged, and only the important policy issues that need the ministry’s intervention should be taken up in such meetings.And, finally, a one-time performance audit of ABs should be undertaken by an independent agency. CAG had done an exhaustive performance audit of autonomous scientific bodies in 2016, highlighting the gaps in their performance. Such a theme-based audit should be done for other ABs as well.Sudeshna Sen works in the finance and accounts department, Indian RailwaysThe views expressed are personal
Updated: Sep 18, 2020 13:53 ISTEver since she got married to Vivek Dahiya in 2016, Divyanka Tripathi has been battling pregnancy rumours.Sometimes, even her fans do not know where to draw the line with personal questions.One well-wisher of the actor made a weird request recently. On a picture of Divyanka on Instagram, the fan dropped a request for the actor, “Mam we all wan’t you to become a mother”. Divyanka, however, came up with a perfectly reasonable reply. “Then you all volunteer to babysit my baby while I work.”Earlier, in 2018, Divyanka had addressed pregnancy rumours in an interview to Hindustan Times. “I’ve been an open book. I make a point to interact with my fans every few days. I have good relations with the media and they’ve been kind to me. My wedding wasn’t a private affair. I understand that our lives are open to public scrutiny and I’ve accepted that. I share my life’s happy moments with my fans and will continue to do so,” she had said.“The most disturbing thing is that these rumours, as much as you want to ignore them, become an integral part of your work life. I’m expected to clarify and my silence has been mistaken for an agreement to the said rumour. But as you grow, you also grow over these rumours,”she had said. adding, “It’s a chain where one doesn’t know how it started or who started it. So, it’s difficult to spot the miscreants. I hope people show some responsibility. But, it doesn’t bother me anymore.”Divyanka and Vivek met on the sets of Yeh Hain Mohabbatein. Recently, she shared a string of tweets about Vivek being described in headlines as ‘Divyanka’s husband.’ She called for a stop to such descriptions.Retweeting a news article,, Divyanka wrote, “Why don’t they refer to it as @VivekDahiya08 and wifey?It wasn’t even my post! I’m here since eons but does the industry give new talent much deserved respect? Let’s not cry fowl on name of nepotism. Vicious circle starts here! Not targeting one. Pointing at a common practice,” she wrote.“Why are the attachments needed to address people-someone’s daughter, son, spouse? Unless news and all in general start respecting sole identities, nepotism won’t stop. Everyone wants to be known by their own work,” she wrote.
Moderna Inc said on Friday it was on track to produce 20 million doses of its experimental coronavirus vaccine by the end of the year, while maintaining its goal of readying 500 million to 1 billion doses in 2021.Vaccines and treatments are seen as essential in controlling the Covid-19 pandemic that has shown no signs of slowing and killed over 944,000 people worldwide.A handful of vaccines, including those from Pfizer Inc and AstraZeneca, are also being tested in large studies.Moderna had enrolled 25,296 participants out of a planned 30,000 in its late-stage study as of Wednesday.The company is working with Switzerland’s Lonza Group AG and Spain’s Laboratorios Farmacéuticos Rovi to make the vaccine outside the United States.Moderna has a vaccine supply deal in place with the U.S. for 100 million doses, and has finished advanced talks with the European Union for the vaccine.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention anticipates that 35 million to 45 million doses of vaccines from the first two companies to receive authorization will be available in the United States by the end of this year.Moderna plans to seek emergency authorization for its vaccine’s use in high-risk groups if it proves to be at least 70% effective, its chief executive officer told Reuters earlier this week.
Donald Trump recently said he has “more Indians” than Kamala Harris, the Indian-descent Democratic nominee for vice-president. His campaign released a video of him with Narendra Modi at the “Howdy Modi” and “Namaste Trump” events, cheered by stadiums packed with Indians (and those of Indian descent).The Biden-Harris campaign was already on it, building on Harris’ part-Indian heritage to further consolidate its hold on the Indian-American community that has traditionally voted Democratic, through outreaches headlined by top campaign officials. It also rolled out a two-pronged agenda for a Biden administration — one part dedicated to relations with India and the other to the welfare of Indian-Americans. It was an unparalleled effort, and exhaustive in scope.Indian-Americans haven’t felt so politically coddled — empowered, you can also say — before. “We have arrived, says some. Others call it the “coming of age.”It’s been a long journey, from the Luce-Celler Act of 1946 that allowed Indians to become naturalised Americans, clearing their way for politics. In 1956, Dalip Singh Saund, a California farmer-judge-politician, who helped organise that effort, was elected to the US House of Representatives, becoming the first Indian-American elected to the US congress. There are five now, including Harris, collectively called, by some, the “Samosa Caucus”. Indian-Americans have also won an increasing number of state-level positions, including two governorships.Year 2020 is more special. The community believes it can make a difference. Both the Trump and Biden campaigns agree.With an estimated 1.8 million eligible voters, Indian-Americans form a tinier than tiny part of the US electorate. But they look heftier because of their weighted equity in battleground — also called swing — states won or lost by slim margins in close contests. Just three of them swung it for Trump in 2016 — Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin; by 0.2, 0.7 and 0.8 percentage points respectively.Democrats are eyeing the 1.3 million Indian-Americans that live in eight states that they believe are in play this time: Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — the above three — and Arizona, Texas, Florida, North Carolina and Georgia. The Trump campaign is looking at Indian-Americans in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Florida.Indian-Americans have historically favoured Democrats. But only 50% of the registered voters among them identified as Democrat, in a survey of Asian-American voters in the run-up to the 2018 mid-term elections; 18% identified themselves as Republicans; and the rest 32% were “non-identifiers”. But two-third of them — 66% — disapproved of Trump’s performance as president and 28% approved.Does Trump have “more Indians”, as he has claimed, than Senator Harris? Only a poll can determine that. But the newly empowered community is clearly enjoying the attention it is getting, with the promise of plenty more in 2024, when, as is being excitedly speculated, it might be Harris versus Nikki Haley.yashwant.raj@hindustantimes.comThe views expressed are personal
A solidly blue state for the past half century, Minnesota became an unquestioned presidential battleground on Friday as President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden fought for working-class voters in dueling events that marked the beginning of early voting.The candidates steered clear of the state’s most populated areas near Minneapolis to focus on rural and blue-collar voters, some of whom shifted to Republicans for the first time in 2016. Trump was headed to Bemidji, about 200 miles (320 kilometers) north of Minneapolis, while Biden campaigned n a suburb of Duluth, on the banks of Lake Superior and close to the Wisconsin border.Biden railed against Trump’s inability to control the pandemic, casting the president’s reluctance to embrace more serious social distancing safeguards as “negligence and selfishness” that cost American lives. At a carpenter union’s training hall, he also emphasized his plans to boost American manufacturing.“It’s time to reward hard work in America and not wealth,” Biden declared with roughly a dozen workers looking on.“When the government spends taxpayers’ money, we should spend that money to buy American products made by American workers and American supply chains to generate American growth,” Biden said. He promised to invest $400 billion in federal money over his first term to ensure more products are made in America.Since narrowly losing Minnesota in 2016, Trump has emphasized the state in hopes that a victory this year could offset losses in other states. He has visited regularly and kept a close eye on issues of particular importance to rural corners of the state. He’s reversed an Obama administration policy prohibiting the development of copper-nickel mining and has bailed out soybean, corn and other farmers who have been hurt by trade clashes with China.More recently, he’s embraced a “law and order” message aimed nationally at white suburban and rural voters who may be concerned by protests that have sometimes become violent. That’s especially true in Minnesota, where the May killing of George Floyd by a police officer sparked a national reckoning on racism.But for all the work Trump has put into the state, it may elude him again in November.A series of polls over the past week show Biden has built a consistent lead in Minnesota. And in the 2018 midterms, Democratic turnout surged in suburbs, small cities and even on the Iron Range, across the blue-collar mining towns that were once labor strongholds but had been trending Republican.David McIntosh, president of the conservative Club for Growth, which has produced anti-Biden ads, said Minnesota may help the Trump campaign build momentum.“They’re looking beyond the poll numbers and seeing the potential there,” said McIntosh, a former congressman from Indiana. “It’s always smart strategy to go on offense somewhere.”In 2018, Democrats flipped two suburban congressional districts, took back control of the state House by winning suburban Trump-voting areas and came within one seat of winning control of the state Senate. Democrats won every statewide race that year, even as they lost a rural congressional district.Trump’s path to Minnesota success likely depends on finding more votes in rural, conservative areas –- running up the score beyond his 2016 tally. It’s a strategy he’s trying to pull off in other states and it depends on a robust field operation with the money and time to track down infrequent or first-time voters. That could be a tall order since Minnesota already has one of the nation’s highest voter turnout rates.“I don’t think they’re there,” said Joe Radinovich, a Democrat who lost a bid for a northern Minnesota congressional district in 2018. Radinovich noted the major organizational challenge and expense in tracking new voters, making sure they’re registered and getting them to vote – especially during a pandemic. “We have relatively high turnout already. Most people vote. I just don’t think it’s there. I think those people showed up in 2016,” he said.In 2016, Trump won that district, which includes the Democratic city of Duluth, by 15 percentage points. But in the midterms two years later, Radinovich lost by just under 6 percentage points.Still, Trump has spent more than a year building a sizable Minnesota ground game. Republicans are out knocking on doors and interacting personally with voters in ways that Democrats mostly have not, preferring online operations because of the coronavirus.The president’s reelection campaign announced this week a $10 million ad buy in a series of states, including Minnesota. It has spent nearly $17 million on advertising in the state since last October, compared with almost $6.3 million for Biden over the same period, according to a review of Kantar/CMAG data by The Associated Press.Democrats warn that Biden still may have his work cut out for him. Duluth Mayor Emily Larson said the Trump campaign has far outpaced Biden in local yard signs — which indicates enthusiasm but may not ultimately affect the outcome.“One of the things the Trump campaign has been very good about is visibility in Duluth, but also in areas around Duluth,” Larson said.Ken Martin, chairman of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, said that while Biden isn’t likely to carry the congressional district that includes Duluth, he might be able to pick up enough support there to deny Trump the votes he needs to win statewide.“If your opponent is on the ropes or on the ground,” Martin said “you don’t let them get up.”

Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa, who was in Delhi after six months on Friday, met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and appealed to him to expedite the release of money from the National Disaster Response Fund. In another meeting with party president JP Nadda, the chief minister discussed the state cabinet expansion as well.Meeting the PM, the CM made a plea to revise the items and norms of assistance from NDRF for the current year itself to ensure timely and adequate assistance to those affected by floods in the state. Twenty two of the 30 districts in the state have been affected by floods and the state has sought assistance of Rs 8,071 crore in this regard.Yediyurappa also urged PM Modi to declare Upper Krishna II and Upper Bhadra as national projects. The Karnataka CM also appealed for early approvals and clearances for irrigation and drinking water projects, including Mekedatu and Kalasa Banduri Nala, to fully utilise water allotted to the state’s share. This was a request he reiterated to the union minister for forest and climate change Prakash Javadekar when he met him later in the evening.The Karnataka CM also invited PM Modi to virtually inaugurate the Bengaluru tech Summit on November 19. The highlight of the visit though was Yediyurappa’s discussions with party President JP Nadda. The CM said that while he was keen to expand the cabinet before the assembly session starts on September 21, he was awaiting directions from the party high command.“About cabinet expansion, I have had a detailed chat with our party president. He has said he will discuss the issue with the Prime Minister,” said Yediyurappa. Asked whether it would be a cabinet reshuffle or expansion, Yediyurappa said: “Depends on the directions I get from the party high command.”Earlier in the day, the CM dismissed Congress’s attack on his son Vijayendra acting as a ‘super CM’ as untrue and false.He also said that not much should be read into the recent meeting between him and JDS leader HD Kumaraswamy.“We have a majority of our own. Why would we require anybody’s help? It was just a courtesy call from him, seeking funds for some of the JDS legislators constituencies,” the CM added.Meanwhile, a number of BJP legislators threw their hat into the cabinet ring, saying that they are aspirants to be inducted into the ministry.MP Renukacharya, Appachu Ranjan, MP Kumaraswamy, Umesh Katti, G Thippa Reddy, AH Vishwanath, MTB Nagaraj, among others, have said that they are aspirants for a ministerial berth. The cabinet currently has 28 members and six berths are still vacant. Karnataka can have a maximum of 34 members of cabinet, including the CM.
Belarus opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya demanded on Friday an international mission to document what she called “atrocities” during crackdowns on anti-government protests but said she was ready to talk to end weeks of violence.She addressed a highly charged debate on the Belarus crisis at the UN Human Rights Council, where envoys from Minsk and its backer Moscow faced off against EU delegations who are pushing for sanctions and investigations.UN rights investigator Anaïs Marin told the session member states needed to act to prevent a major geopolitical rift. “Let’s not allow another Iron curtain to descend on the European continent,” she said.Marin said more than 10,000 people have been “abusively arrested”, with more than 500 reports of torture and thousands “savagely beaten”, since President Alexander Lukashenko retained power after a disputed presidential election on Aug. 9.Protesters say the vote was fraudulent. Lukashenko says he won the vote fairly by a landslide, and dismisses accusations of abuses which he says are part of a Western smear campaign.Marin’s speech was interrupted several times by objections from other UN members including Russian, Belarusian and other delegations who called a halt to her participation.The UN Human Rights Council session will consider an EU draft resolution for UN rights chief Michelle Bachelet to monitor the crisis and report back by year-end.Tsikhanouskaya, in a video message to the 47-member state forum, called for the monitoring mission and said the government should hold another election.“I once again emphasize our willingness to talk with the authorities and look for peaceful solution to the crisis that has affected our nation,” added Tskihanouskaya, who fled her homeland for Lithuania during the protests.“We demand to immediately cease violence against peaceful citizens. We demand immediate release of all political prisoners,” she said.President Vladimir Putin, Lukashenko’s main ally, agreed to loan Belarus $1.5 billion at a summit on Monday, and the two countries are conducting joint military training exercises in Belarus.Russia’s defence ministry said on Friday that special forces from Russia and Belarus had rehearsed a counter-terrorism scenario involving freeing hostages from a building in their “Slavic Brotherhood 2020” drills.It said more than 800 military personnel from the two countries were taking part in the training near the Belarusian city of Brest.During the UN debate, Ukraine’s foreign minister warned Russia against taking steps that may undermine the sovereignty of Belarus and destabilise the region.“It is heartbreaking to watch the footage of our close neighbours viciously beaten down and arbitrarily detained on the streets of their native cities,” Dmytro Kuleba told the debate.
Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap said in a recent interview that actor and Member of Parliament, Ravi Kishan used to smoke weed. Now, Ravi has said that he didn’t expect such a statement from Anurag.Ravi told ANI on Saturday, “I didn’t expect such words from Anurag Kashyap. It’s no secret I am a devotee of Shiva so I chant his name. I’m saddened he would not support me on this issue of the war on drugs & say that I smoked up & am now clean just because I’m a minister, which I’m not: Ravi Kishan.”I didn't expect such words from Anurag Kashyap. It's no secret I am a devotee of Shiva so I chant his name. I'm saddened he would not support me on this issue of the war on drugs & say that I smoked up & am now clean just because I'm a minister, which I'm not: Ravi Kishan, BJP MP pic.twitter.com/6v9vxj9Fdc — ANI (@ANI) September 19, 2020Anurag had said in an interview to journalist Faye D’Souza that he is doesn’t agree with Ravi’s self--righteous stand in the Parliament against Bollywood and Indian youth’s drug problem. He said, “Ravi Kishan acted in my last film Mukkabaaz. Ravi Kishan starts his day by saying Jai Shiv Shankar, Jai Bam Bhole. Jai Shiv Shambhu. For the longest period of his time, he has been somebody who has used weed. It is life. Everybody knows it. The whole world knows. There’s not a single person who doesn’t know that Ravi Kishan does not smoke up. He might have quit now, that he has become a minister, he might have cleaned up.”Appreciating him as a person, he had further added, “But do you include that in drugs? No. I am not judging Ravi, because I have never seen weed as a drug. ‘Abuse’ is not the word. He used to smoke up. He has always been functional, he has always done his job well, it did not make him dysfunctional, did not make him a monster. It did not do anything that people associate with drugs. So when he talks about it, when he takes a self righteous stand, I have a problem with that.”Ravi Kishan had said in his Parliament speech during the monsoon session that there was indeed a problem of drug addiction in the film industry. He said, “Drug addiction is in the film industry too. Several people have been apprehended. The NCB has been doing very good work. I urge the central government to take strict action against the culprits soon. Give them a befitting punishment and bring an end to this conspiracy by neighbouring countries.”
Updated: Sep 17, 2020 07:32 ISTShweta Singh Kirti, sister of late actor Sushant Singh Rajput has decided to take some time off social media as she continues to try coping with her loss. In an emotional note that she posted late Wednesday, Shweta remembered some valuable moments with Sushant - like sharing a joke or simply being able to touch him. She also said she would like to meditate in an attempt to “heal completely”.Sharing a lovely picture with the late actor, Shweta wrote on Instagram late Wednesday, “How much ever you try to stay strong, but at times this strong pain takes over that Bhai is actually not there anymore. Will never be able to touch him or see him laugh or listen to him cracking jokes... I wonder how long will it take to heal completely. Have decided to take 10 days off from being online and immerse myself in deep meditation and prayers. Really need to heal from this pain.”Fans of the late actor showered the post with love, asking Shweta to take her time and also take care of herself. “Stay strong dii we are always with you....and we respect your decision of 10 days being off from social media,” wrote one fan. Another one commented, “Dii, We know Sometimes social media is really toxic and tiring and we also know that how much current time is hard for you. I pray that you heal soon and come back stronger. Take care of yourself and family. And remember, we are here for you always!”Interestingly, Shweta has spearheaded several online campaigns in past few months, seeking justice for her brother who was found dead in his Mumbai apartment on June 14. Currently, the top agencies of the country - the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) - are investigating into the actor’s death. His girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty, alongwith a few others, has been arrested for procurement of drugs in connection with the case.Sharing a creative about making some of the dreams of Sushant come alive, Shweta had recently written on social media, “What a great initiative by the extended family! Bhai will always be Alive in us through his dreams...because we are going to live them!! SSRians will make #DreamsOfSSR A Reality! What a Great Way to celebrate a Great Life!.”
The 13th edition of the Indian Premier League is set to kick off from September 19th in the UAE. Some of the biggest names of the modern-day cricket will be performing in the IPL this year and all eyes will be on them with fans getting a chance to see their favourite cricketers perform after a long time.Also Follow | IPL 2020 Full CoverageBut here is the big question - who will win the prestigious Purple Cap for being the highest wicket-taker this year in the UAE? The UAE tracks are known for being slow and the type that support spinners, hence, it will be interesting to see how some of the best bowlers fare in what promises to be testing conditions.Also Read | Virat Kohli was a bit of a loner, backed wrong players at times: Former RCB coachWe have narrowed the list down to the below five cricketers.1) Jasprit BumrahThere is a reason why Jasprit Bumrah is regarded as one of the best bowlers in the current day and age. The right-arm fast bowler has often faced criticism that he is not able to give a good start with the new ball. This time, in the absence of Lasith Malinga, Bumrah will have the dual responsibility on his shoulders to give a good start and wickets in the death overs. The pacer got 19 wickets last season and was MI’s leading wicket-taker. He can certainly better it and fetch the purple cap this year.Also Read | How an Olympic sprinter is helping KKR get faster2) Pat CumminsPat Cummins was bought by Rs 15.5 crore by Kolkata Knight Riders and he will certainly have the pressure on him to justify the price tag. The Aussie speedster has been in good form over the years, and has been able to rise among the bowling ranks with consistent performers. Cummins’ speed and accuracy are his biggest strengths and he will certainly be one of the bowlers to watch out for this season.3) Rashid KhanRashid Khan has been the backbone of Sunrisers Hyderabad’s bowling attack for a number of years now. The leg-spinner has proven to be economical, and on his day, has the ability to take multiple wickets and rattle the middle order like a pack of cards. He had taken 17 wickets in 15 games last year and the Afghanistan leggie will be eager to do even better this year, especially on tracks that will promise to help his bowling style.4) Kagiso RabadaDelhi Capitals’ fast bowling asset Kagiso Rabada is a threat wherever he goes. Rabada’s strength lies in his ability to quickly adapt to conditions and where he can morph into a serial wicket-taker. He came close to bagging the purple cap, picking 25 wickets last season, missing the top spot by just one scalp. Rabada led DC’s bowling unit last season, playing a key role in the team reaching the Playoffs. If the Rabada magic works again, Delhi could finally go on to win the title.5) Deepak ChaharThe final choice was between two Chennai Super Kings players - Deepak Chahar and Imran Tahir. Tahir bagged the Purple Cap last year with 26 wickets in the tournament. But this year, Chahar could be the one to pip him to the post. The right-arm seamer had taken 22 wickets last year and missed out on the top spot by just four wickets. Chahar had a health scare at the start of the IPL and fiercely determined for a fresh season. Following an insipid performance against West Indies last year, Chahar would want to kick off IPL with all guns blazing.
News of a contraction of almost 24% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in the first quarter of this year would have come as a shock to every responsible citizen. The degree of contraction exceeds that in any major world economy. This is not surprising as India combined the world’s most stringent lockdown with the weakest economic stimulus.For perspective, the actual fiscal impulse has amounted to less than 2% of (2019) GDP while it has been close to 10% in the United States (US). The difference finds its reflection in the relative rates of contraction, with GDP in the US contracting by 9% in the April-June quarter compared to two-and-a-half times that in India. There is no doubt that we are observing something that will have a deep and lasting impact on the economy unless the government responds to this news with decisive and quick action. Above all, a functional economic policy is what is needed now, rather than one that is attractive to the government for reasons either ideological or aesthetic.That the future of the economy can no longer be ignored is obvious. The lockdown was justified on the grounds that lives are more important than livelihoods. But, life having to be lived without a livelihood is not acceptable five months after the lockdown was first imposed.Every effort needs to be made to restore economic activity while requiring adherence to wearing masks, social distancing and hand-sanitising. With the magnitude of the contraction now known, the daunting scale of the challenge is evident. The response of policy has to be different from what the government has so far pursued in the name of addressing it.The nature of the government’s response until now may be seen in the two rounds of announcements made, the first soon after the lockdown was announced in late March, and the other in mid-May. The first was mainly in the form of enhanced rations and the front-loading of payments already announced to farmers under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman scheme, which, as an income-support scheme, would be deemed selective. The second round of announcements by finance minister (FM) Nirmala Sitharaman had two components: A set of guarantees for loans to be made by banks to the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and the agricultural sector, and a host of structural reforms. The latter includes private sector entry into defence production and changes to existing laws related to the marketing of agricultural produce.Totalling the additional public expenditure, the loan amount guaranteed by the Government of India, and liquidity provision announced by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the government asserted that it had provided a “stimulus” amounting to 10% of GDP. This was immediately called out as a tall claim, for additional spending announced by the government was estimated at less than 2% of GDP. It is not surprising that the contraction in India has been as severe.We will have to await the GDP data for the second quarter of the financial year to know whether a recovery has taken place after June. Despite the Centre having lifted the nationwide lockdown, either statewide closures or lockdown in the containment zones, has continued in some parts of the country. However, it would be unwise to expect a V-shaped recovery. Production is undertaken with an eye to demand, and consumption would have fallen with the income loss, as production had been shut down due to the lockdown for most of the first quarter. Firms are likely to wait for inventories to come down to normal levels before restoring production to past peaks.But the most important reason for believing that a rapid return to normalcy may not be taking place right now is on grounds of the reduction by up to a third in investment as share of GDP, reported by the government along with the most recent GDP figures. Most of this reduction is likely to be of private investment. Private investment will not revive in a hurry given the magnitude of the contraction in output. The present state of the economy is not conducive to investment, nor is the cost of credit down despite RBI’s efforts. The real bank lending rate for fresh loans is higher than it was in March when evaluated in terms of the Wholesale Price Index, which presumably is what matters to investors.The only lever left is the one the government has revealed itself to be most reluctant to use thus far, and that is public spending tilted towards investment. The pandemic has exposed the parlous state of public health infrastructure in the country. Expansion in public spending could start right there. And, not only because health is constitutionally a state subject but also because state governments are closer to the ground, the Centre could transfer funds to the states for deployment. For this, the Government of India would have to borrow, either from the public or RBI.At the best of times, economic policy should be functional and not tied down by a dogma that excludes certain options. We are now living in extraordinary times and only extraordinary measures will do.Pulapre Balakrishnan is professor of economics at Ashoka University, SonipatThe views expressed are personal
Actor Taapsee Pannu has said that even though she does not know Rhea Chakraborty personally, she must speak against the treatment the latter has received in the media. Taapsee believes that many have branded Rhea the culprit behind Sushant Singh Rajput’s death even before the court can pass its judgement.“In this particular case, as I have always maintained, I really didn’t know her at all. I still don’t know her. The only problem I had was the kind of unfair trial that was happening and the kind of judgement that was passed on her. It’s not that before we haven’t had criminals from other industries or people being caught for doing something wrong from other industries. Even in our industry, for that matter. We have had a couple of big stars being caught but the way this girl went through the media trial and physical harassment at some places, it was something very shocking and something I couldn’t hold back. I had to speak up without even knowing anything about her,” she said in a new interview.Taapsee was speaking to India Today and added, “There are people who support this point of view and there are people who probably have just written her off in their mind before the court or the investigative agencies have given their verdict. They want to force this opinion in everyone’s head. So I think that is wrong.”Taapsee also shared her thoughts on veteran actor and Rajya Sabha MP Jaya Bachchan’s speech in the Parliament on Bollywood’s image being tarnished. “For we have always stood by the initiatives, causes and awareness campaigns. It’s time for payback. Hitting the nail on its head and how ! yet again a woman from the industry spoke up #Respect,” Taapsee tweeted on Tuesday.Jaya’s speech, in which she used a Hindi proverb to say those defaming the industry were biting the hands that fed them, earned her fulsome praise from many of her colleagues in Bollywood that has been under a cloud since the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput in June. Though she did not take any names, her speech came a day after BJP’s Lok Sabha MP and Bhojpuri actor Ravi Kishan said there was a problem of drug addiction in the film industry. She also said she completely disagrees with those who term the entertainment industry a “gutter”, a term used by actor Kangana Ranaut to describe Bollywood in a tweet last month.
A drive-by shooting wounded a court security officer Tuesday outside the federal courthouse in downtown Phoenix, authorities said.City police said the officer was taken to a hospital and is expected to recover. Police also released a photo of a silver sedan that was spotted leaving the area of the courthouse.The court security officer works for the US Marshals Service and was struck in their protective vest, said a law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the investigation publicly.Court security officers work under the direction of the US Marshals Service but generally are employed by private security companies.The shooting came after the weekend ambush of two Los Angeles County deputies who were sitting in their parked police vehicle when a man walked up to the passenger’s side and fired multiple rounds.The deputies were struck in the head and critically wounded but are expected to recover. The gunman hasn’t been captured and a motive has not been determined.In Phoenix, City Councilman Sal DiCiccio said in a statement that the security officer was shot in front of the Sandra Day O’Connor US Courthouse.
Paytm on Friday evening said it’s back on Google Play Store after it was pulled down for allegedly violating gambling policies.Update: And we're back! — Paytm (@Paytm) September 18, 2020Earlier in the day, Google Play Store, the official Android app-store, had removed the Paytm app from its list of apps over violation of its policies on sports betting activities.The other Paytm apps like Paytm for Business, Paytm Mall, Paytm Money, Paytm Mall Store Manager and Paytm Instore Manager are still available for download and installation.Thanks everyone for your support! Paytm App is back, live in Play Store.We launched a UPI CashBack campaign this morning. Our app got suspended by Google for this.India, you decide if giving cash back is gambling. pic.twitter.com/w5Rcrs6lLT — Vijay Shekhar Sharma (@vijayshekhar) September 18, 2020Paytm app, which has millions of active users who use it for cashless transactions, was “removed for violating Play Store’s policy on sport betting activities”, Google said.“The app was blocked for violation of play policies - a clarification of our policy was released earlier today ahead of the IPL tournament,” Google told the news agency PTI in an email response. They further added that there will be no impact on users.Paytm via a tweet had informed users that the payments app will be back on Google’s Play Store and is temporarily unavailable. Paytm said, “It will be back very soon. All your money is completely safe, and you can continue to enjoy your Paytm app as normal.”Google had published a blog by Android Security and Privacy Vice President Product Suzanne Frey stating their policies regarding gambling apps.“We don’t allow online casinos or support any unregulated gambling apps that facilitate sports betting. This includes if an app leads consumers to an external website that allows them to participate in paid tournaments to win real money or cash prizes, it is a violation of our policies,” the blog post read.The blog post explained that Google then asks the developers of the app to bring it under compliance of their policies. Once it is done, the app is restored on the Play Store. If the developer fails to follow or there are continuous violations of these policies then Google can “ terminate Google Play Developer accounts.”Paytm app users can still use their app if it is installed on their phones. It is the 6th most downloaded fintech app, according to the Sensor Tower - a website that provides “enterprise-level data on mobile apps and publishers.”Paytm has 450 million users and apart from being a payment app, it provides features like online shopping, gaming and banking along with other services.(With inputs from PTI)
Updated: Sep 19, 2020 21:07 ISTThe defence ministry has not taken any decision on selling only “Made in India” products in military canteens run by it across the country, the government said on Saturday.“No decision has been taken in this regard,” Minister of State for Defence Shripad Naik said in Rajya Sabha.He was replying to a question on whether the defence ministry will consider using and selling only “Made in India” products in its stores in light of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s focus on self-reliance and “vocal for local”.In an address to the nation in May, Modi spoke extensively on the need to focus on a “self-reliant India” and called for promoting products made in India with a larger aim of making Indian economy stronger.In his reply, Naik also said that the total turnover of defence canteens in 2017-18 was Rs 17,190 crore and it went up to Rs 18,917 crore in 2018-19. The total turnover was reported at Rs 17,588 in 2019-20.In the current fiscal, the figure has been recorded at Rs 3,692 crore till August, he said.In reply to a separate question on whether government signed a contract with a private company to modernise 37 airfields, he replied in the affirmative.“Modernisation of airfield infrastructure has enhanced the capability in terms of facilitating operation in poor weather conditions including night operations, enhanced enroute navigation infrastructure and enhanced traffic handling capabilities,” he said.To a separate question, Naik said 86 military airbases are functioning in the country.
New Zealand fell into its deepest economic slump on record in the second quarter as its battle against the coronavirus pandemic paralysed business activity, official data showed on Thursday.Gross domestic product contracted a seasonally adjusted 12.2% quarter-on-quarter, its sharpest quarterly contraction on record and largely in line with forecasts of a 12.8% decline from economists polled by Reuters. GDP fell 12.4% year-on-year.The Reserve Bank of New Zealand had forecast a quarterly and annual GDP decline of 14% in its August statement.Growth has been hit by a standstill in economic activity as a strict nationwide coronavirus lockdown in April and parts of May forced almost everyone to stay at home and businesses to shut.The GDP data confirms New Zealand’s worst recession, defined as two straight quarters of contraction, since 2010, with GDP in the March quarter falling 1.6%.In comparison, second quarter economic growth in neighbouring Australia which enforced a less stringent COVID-19 lockdown fell 7.0%, while the United States recorded a 9.1% drop.But economists say New Zealand will bounce back faster, while other nations are still struggling to contain the coronavirus.“We expect the June quarter’s record-breaking GDP decline to be followed by a record-breaking rise in the September quarter,” said Westpac Senior Economist Michael Gordon.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s government, which faces an election on Oct. 17, has said success in suppressing the virus locally is likely to help recovery prospects.Treasury forecasts released on Wednesday showed that while New Zealand’s response to COVID-19 helped lessen the short-term economic shock, massive debt and continuing disruptions will delay a full recovery.Economists say the GDP data will have little impact on the central bank’s policy, which is expected to hold interest rates at a record low of 0.25% at its meeting on Sept. 23.
Kareena Kapoor and son Taimur have been making visits to her mother Babita or sister Karisma Kapoor’s houses post lockdown. Little Taimur was recently seen accompanying Kareena to Babita’s house and dancing in a playful mood.The mother-son duo was captured arriving at Babita’s home by the paparazzi. While Kareena was in a black tracksuit and floaters, Taimur was dressed in a shirt and trousers. Both of them wore masks for safety. As soon as Kareena stepped out of her car and asked Taimur to hold her hand, he started making funny movements in excitement as if dancing. As Kareena stopped for a while to pose for the paparazzi, Taimur also posed alongside her with a swag of his own.Kareena is currently expecting her second child with husband Saif Ali Khan. The couple said in a statement last month, “We are very pleased to announce that we are expecting an addition to our family !!Thank you to all our well wishers for all their love and support,”Meanwhile, Kareena has also been busy shooting for her numerous photo shoots and commercials. She posted a glamorous picture on Instagram as she got ready for a shoot with the help of her ‘warriors’.

The film also starred Kiara Advani and Diljit Dosanjh. She is currently also working on her next, Laal Singh Chaddha, opposite Aamir Khan.
Actor Manoj Bajpayee has said that he still cannot believe that actor Sushant Singh Rajput has died. Manoj said that all the debate and discussion around his death has led to people forgetting all about celebrating the actor.Speaking about Sushant in an interview, Manoj said news channels only care about their TRPs. He said, “They forgot to celebrate him. TRP has become the focus now. So that’s why I said that there are so many vested interests now, who would want to talk about how (Sushant) used to code? Right now, every thing is focused on TRPs. I don’t watch television. Whatever I see, its on Twitter, on Instagram.”“Whatever is happening, I doubt anyone is mourning him. Because every hour, the topic of debate is changing. And it’s sad, it’s very sad, whatever I have seen in the last couple of months. Right now, no matter what I say, my words will be interpreted as something else. There are so many vested interests, everyone will take my statement however they want. So where is Sushant in all this? I still cannot believe that he is not there anymore. Theheartbreak me, Shekhar Kapoor, his family have felt, we still cannot believe it. Whatever is happening is pathetic. I think we have all left Sushant behind in all this,” he told Bollywood Hungama.Manoj and Sushant worked together in last year’s Sonchiriya. The two played dacoits in the movie that was directed by Abhishek Chaubey.Earlier in an interview to Pinkvilla, Manoj had talked about Sushant’s achievements. “All of us have our highs and lows and emotions. Sushant was no different. I don’t think I am as talented as that. I don’t think I am as intelligent and as bright as he used to be. I don’t think I had achieved anything till the age of 34, what he achieved, as compared to his achievements. I feel that my achievements are very very small. That is how I remember him. I don’t remember him not only as a good human being.”Sushant died on June 14 at his Bandra apartment. His death and its investigation that followed has become the national conversation in the last three months.

Updated: Sep 17, 2020 18:44 ISTCricket Australia on Thursday revealed that Steve Smith is following “concussion protocols” which are crucial for his return to cricket in the IPL and asserted that it is “not willing” to compromise with the fitness of the Rajasthan Royals skipper.CA said it is working in tandem with RR to ensure his smooth return to competitive action after missing the entire England ODI series due to the concussion suffered during training.“Cricket Australia has strict protocols when it comes to head impacts and concussions and, as we’ve seen over the last 12 months, we’re not willing to compromise on those,” CA’s head of sports science Alex Kountouris said in a statement.Also Read | Predicting big things for him in IPL: Lee on world’s most dangerous batsman“Steve is making progress and working with our medical team through the concussion protocols required to return to play,” he added.Smith along with other England and Australia cricketers will arrive in Dubai on Thursday night (UAE time) and undergo a six-day quarantine which means they will all miss action till September 23. RR’s first match is on September 22 against Chennai Super Kings.Smith was hit on the head during a net session prior to the first ODI in Manchester and since then recovered well but not enough to play a competitive cricket.Kountouris said the franchise and CA will be working together to monitor Smith’s fitness upon his arrival in the UAE.Smith had also endured a concussion during last year’s Ashes game at the Lord’s and subsequently missed a Test match.“The conservative management of Steve through this injury is consistent with our approach to put the player’s welfare first, as we did with him during the Ashes last year,” Kountouris said.The former physio, who has had a long association with the Sri Lankan national team followed by Australians, hinted that CA will not like Smith to be rushed into a match situation.“We are striving to create environments where players trust that our medical team will always put their welfare first and therefore speak openly with them, whether this is about concussion, other injuries or mental health,” he stated.Kountouris said that a lot of research has gone into studying concussions and its related effects.“We have done a lot of research over the last few years to better understand head impacts and concussions specific to cricket, and that has helped up in how we manage our players.“We place the welfare of the player before the game because we strongly believe that is what’s best for the player.”
Privatisation of the railways will create a win-win situation for both the Indian railways as well as the investors, and also the users, Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said on Thursday, addressing a joint press meet, along with Railway Board chairman VK Yadav.“It is like when private banks were set up in India. So many private players came in the banking sector. But that didn’t lead SBI to shut. Private investment will bring in newer technologies. It will create competition in the railway sector. Competition will increase efficiency and reduce fare — in the long run,” Kant said.Also Read | Crack trains: How railways put goods movement on fast track during Covid 19On airport-like user charge to be levied for redeveloped railway stations, Railway Board chairman VK Yadav said the charge, which will translate to a hike in railway fare, will be nominal. “The user charge will be nominal. Also, the charge will be applicable only for redeveloped stations. Not all stations are being redeveloped at present,” Yadav said.On the issue of private players being able to determine their own fares — as it has been decided by the Indian Railways — the railway Board chairman said as there will be competition from bus fares and air fares, private players will, in no circumstances, charge exorbitant fares.
Donald Trump on Saturday touted a “fantastic” deal that could see Oracle and Walmart become the US tech partners for TikTok, which the president is seeking to ban over security concerns.“I think it’s going to be a fantastic deal,” Trump said. “I have given the deal my blessing. If they get it done that’s great, if they don’t that’s okay too.”The United States on Friday ordered a ban on downloads of the wildly popular Chinese-owned video app, escalating a fight with Beijing over technology.TikTok users could keep accessing the service through November 12, a timeframe that potentially allows for a tie-up between TikTok -- owned by China’s ByteDance -- and a US company to safeguard data for the app to allay Washington’s security concerns.With Trump facing a tough re-election campaign, US officials have described the measures as essential to safeguard against potential Chinese espionage through the platforms.But in response China’s Commerce Ministry on Saturday condemned what it called US “bullying,” saying it violated international trade norms and that there was no evidence of any security threat, shortly before launching a mechanism that would allow it to sanction foreign companies.Trump critics have said that while TikTok’s security risks were unclear, the sweeping ban raises concerns about the government’s ability to regulate free expression.The ban ramps up the battle with Beijing over technology, which some analysts say is based more on competitive than security concerns.
The raging wildfires in the US West Coast have brought climate crisis to the forefront of the election campaign, with Democratic challenger Joe Biden attacking Republican President Donald Trump for his attitude towards the issue.While touring parts of California, Trump on Monday reiterated his scepticism of climate change, saying, “It’ll start getting cooler, you just watch.”He said many other countries have “more explosive trees, meaning they catch fire much easier”, but they don’t have problems like this. “I think this is more of a management situation,” he added.“When you get into climate change, well, is India going to change its ways? And is China going to change its ways? And Russia? Is Russia going to change its ways?” Trump questioned after landing in McLellan Park in California.Calling Trump a “climate arsonist”, Biden pledged to rejoin the historic Paris Agreement on climate change if elected in the November 3 presidential election. “If we have four more years of Trump’s climate denial, how many suburbs will be burned by wildfires? How many suburban neighbourhoods will have been flooded out?” he asked in a policy speech on climate change.“While he (Trump) turned against our allies, I’ll bring us back into the Paris Agreement. I will put us back in the business of leading the world on climate change, and I will challenge every other country to up the ante on climate commitments.”The Paris accord committed the US and 187 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and attempting to limit them even more, to a 1.5C rise. The decision by the US, one of the world’s top emitters of greenhouse gases, to exit the pact had led to condemnation from environmentalists and world leaders.Biden said, “I’ll also see American workers building and installing 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations along our newly engaged infrastructure programmes and highways all across the country.”Wildfires in 10 states including California have burnt down nearly 5 million acres of land and killed dozens of people.Local officials of Democrat-ruled California accepted the importance of forest management but argued climate change should be accepted as having played a role in the fires.

MS DhoniCaptain of Chennai Super Kings, MS Dhoni is expected to be a big draw, simply because he returns to cricket after a gap of 14 months. Having last played cricket at last year’s World Cup, Dhoni announced his international retirement in August, which means the IPL becomes all the more important for him. With three IPL titles to his name and the experience of leading the most consistent team among all eight franchises, Dhoni will have a bigger role to play than all other seasons in the absence of Suresh Raina.

Despite switching ships from RCB to Kings XI Punjab, the big-hitting Jamaican continued his love affair with the IPL, piling up 368 and 490 runs respectively in the previous two seasons. At 40, Gayle may not be the fittest or the most agile player around, but the power in those muscles refused to die down. Having last played cricket in January, expect Gayle to explode.4. David WarnerThe IPL always brings the best out of Sunrisers Hyderabad captain David Warner. Consider this: In the previous three IPL seasons, Warner has racked up 848, 641 and 692 runs in 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively. This followed a couple of seasons with 528 and 562 runs. It should be a no-brainer that Warner is one of IPL’s most consistent big-hitters. Last season, fresh off his 12-month ban, Warner plundered one century and eight fifties to lead SRH’s charge and there is no reason why he cannot do it two years in a row.5. Rohit SharmaWhat do you say about a batsman with three ODI double centuries? MI skipper Rohit Sharma has been in the form of his life ever since he struck those record five centuries at last year’s World Cup. Ever since, he has excelled as an opener in Test cricket and as he gears up to break Mumbai Indians’ pattern of winning the IPL title every alternate year since 2013, hoping for an encore, big things will be expected from the MI captain. Having made his intentions of opening the batting clear means Rohit will get to face the maximum number of balls and once he is set, we know what he’s capable of.

Updated: Sep 15, 2020 15:23 ISTBhojpuri actor and BJP member of parliament Lok Sabha, Ravi Kishan on Tuesday slammed Samajwadi Party MP and veteran actor Jaya Bachchan on Tuesday over her “bite the hands that feed them” comment. He said he worked his way up in the film industry without anybody’s support.“There is a conspiracy to finish our film industry by hollowing it out. As a responsible member of film industry, it is not just my right but my duty to raise it in Parliament and Jaya-ji should respect that. I am just a son of a priest who crawled his way up and has worked in 600 films,” Kishan said while speaking to ANI.“I expected Jaya ji to support what I said. Not everyone in the industry consumes drugs but those who do are part of a plan to finish the world’s largest film industry. When Jaya ji joined, the situation was not like this but now we need to protect the industry,” he added.The comments from Kishan came after Bachchan, during the zero hour in the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday, in a veiled manner criticised him for stating that “drug addiction is in the film industry”.“Just because of a few people, you cannot tarnish the whole industry... I was really embarrassed and ashamed that yesterday one of our members in the Lok Sabha, who is from the industry, spoke against the film industry. They bite the hands that feed them,” Bachchan stated.She also stated that people working in the entertainment industry are “flogged” by social media.“People in the entertainment industry are being flogged by social media. People who made their name in the industry have called it a gutter. I completely disagree. I hope that the government tells such people not to use this kind of language,” she said.This comes at the time when the Narcotics Control Bureau, Mumbai is undertaking an investigation into alleged drug use and supply in the industry that had surfaced during a probe into the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput.The monsoon session of Parliament commenced from Monday with several precautionary measures due to the coronavirus pandemic. The session is slated to conclude on October 1.
The latest (2019) data on prisons released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) shows that Dalits, tribals, and Muslims continue to be jailed in numbers disproportionate to their share in the total population of India, according to a report in The Indian Express. The NCRB data shows that while people from Scheduled Castes (SCs) accounted for 21.7% of convicts and 21% of undertrials; those from Scheduled Tribes (STs) accounted for 13.6% of convicts and 10.5% of undertrials; and Muslims, 16.6% of convicts and 18.7% of undertrials.While it is not the case that the demographic mix in prison must be a reflection of the demographic mix in society, the NCRB data underlines a deeper sociological truth about India — of the historic marginalisation of these communities. Their socioeconomic indicators are weak; they are unable to access opportunities for livelihoods; their encounters with the legal machinery are common and often brutal; and if they are implicated in cases, even ordinary crimes, they often have to battle discriminatory attitudes and are unable to access effective legal support. It is not surprising that African-Americans constitute a disproportionate number of prisoners in the United States (US). It is not because Blacks in the US, or the Dalits, Muslims or tribals in India, violate the law more often than others — it is because structural conditions in both society and the State force a certain life on them.While there is a larger battle that must be fought to change this discriminatory structure, an immediate priority must be providing urgent legal help. A State-run free legal aid system was introduced in 1995 with the establishment of the Legal Services Authorities Act. But, legal experts suggest that the system has been ineffective because of daunting procedures, low remuneration from the State, and corruption discourage lawyers from taking up these cases. Ensuring access to justice must be the first step to correcting the imbalance in India’s prisons.
I think fashion will undergo a sea change in the coming months which will define its future trajectory. It’s a departure from bare shoulders, ruffles, belted waists, tiers, embroidered sweet whispers in organza, what’s new is an eco-vision as the pandemic has removed the rose tinted glasses. The whole idea of reuse, recycle and buy back has now found a renewed interest.“Revolutionary” is the buzzword and with this comes the wings of freedom, where you can wear your mother’s trousseau by refashioning it. What I have observed is the growth in the handloom sector and a willingness to adopt textiles which are an embodiment of timelessness within the framework of couture.Unlike the need to create endlessly, now you make on-demand smaller capsule collections, which are pointed. With seasons and trends fading away, the pressure has eased on the style hemisphere, where you are launching more solution-based ensembles with versatility. One outfit, can be worn in three different ways or revisiting vintage techniques, which are labour intensive but possess powerful imagery are now gaining steam.Slow fashion:The philosophy of ownership is also transforming, as you are repurposing with purpose, and getting innovative with existing materials. Valaya has brides who come to him with their mother’s trousseau asking for a modern twist, in keeping, with his “royal” ideology. While Shantanu and Nikhil have started a buy back scheme for their old garments where you can win credit notes under ——Re-love, Re-own & Re-use.Amit Aggarwal has been a champion of sorts working extensively with metallic accents that sometimes come from used pipes, polymers intermingling it with textiles and sparking a conversation on how important it is to pursue less is more.Code Red:If you study the India Couture Week 2020 collections, they have been injected with vibrant hues to probably add a bit of sunshine to a gloomy last 6 months. From sindoori red to vivacious fuchsias, there has been a new palate for palettes.Live action shopping is outdated, one-on-one styling appointments, real time and the digital closet is the next wave. The good part this year, is the see now, buy now model, will allow consumers to get their hands on what they have just finished viewing.There is a rise of e fitting, phygital experiences, Artificial intelligence and virtual models. I foresee a time when technology will enable you to select your own fabric and print making it custom-built adapting to altering social behaviour.I think couture will also leave its formality and modern separates will be a norm.Intimate weddings have brought out the best in designers with experimentation becoming the flag bearer as tradition meets technology with a “feel great” factor. As long as brides need one-of-a-kind clothing, that is individual and suited to their fantasies, couture will reach the pinnacle of prosperity. It is here to stay and rule the world.
A committee constituted by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has opined that as of now, there is no conclusive evidence for foodborne transmission of Covid-19, Lok Sabha was informed on Friday.It was also informed that food imported into India from Covid-19 affected countries is safe for human consumption. Consequent upon the Covid-19 outbreak in China and other countries and concerns raised regarding safety of food items imported from these countries, the FSSAI had constituted a committee of experts to examine the possibility of presence of Covid-19 in food imported from these countries and address the concerns in this regard.“The committee, in its report, opined that as of now, there is no conclusive evidence for foodborne transmission of coronavirus and concluded that food imported into India from coronavirus-affected countries is safe for human consumption,” Minister of State for Health Ashwini Choubey said in a written reply.The committee agreed with the advisories of global organisations like the World Health Organisation (WHO), Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) that the predominant routes of transmission of Covid-19 appear to be human-to-human.In light of findings of the expert committee, a press release was issued by the FSSAI on March 5 to address the concerns of consumers and general public in this regard. Commissioners of Food Safety of all states and union territories were also advised vide letter dated March 6 to take appropriate steps to disseminate correct information to consumers and general public to counter any false propaganda.During the lockdown period, import clearance of food items and food testing laboratories (National Food labs at NCR and Kolkata and FSSAI accredited private labs) were classified as essential services and regular import clearance procedure was followed.To guide the public and Food Business Operators (FBOs) about safe food practices and facilitate the FBOs to ensure that the food supply chain is not affected, a number of steps have been taken by the FSSAI as part of which a detailed guidance note ‘Food Hygiene and Safety Guidelines for Food Businesses during Coronavirus Disease (Covid-19) Pandemic’ has been released.An e-handbook on ‘Eat Right during Covid-19’ for citizens highlighting safe food practices to be followed and tips on health and nutrition has been released.The FSSAI is using its social media extensively to disseminate information amid Covid-19, including public awareness material on eating right during coronavirus.To avoid delay in issuance of license where licensing authority decided to conduct inspection prior to issue of license, licensing authorities were asked to conduct it by way of inspection. This has been extended up to December 31 this year.The FBOs, other than manufacturers, were allowed to temporarily operate their businesses on the basis of application for license/registration submitted online. This facility has been extended up to December 31 this year.The FBOs, whose FSSAI license/registration expired with effect from August 1, 2019, have been given grace period and allowed to continue their food businesses with their existing license/registration number without any late fee.The FSSAI also initiated through its flagship Food Safety Training and Certification (FoSTaC) programme, an online training module for food handlers on the essentials of food safety and hygiene practices during Covid 19 through its empanelled partners.The food authority interacted with top leaders of the food industry on May 12 with an aim to ensure uninterrupted food supply while minimising the risk of Covid-19 for workers, customers and players in the food supply chain. The discussions helped address most of the concerns and challenges voiced by the food industry.
On Friday, the total number of Covid-19 cases in India crossed four million. By Sunday, India overtook Brazil to become the world’s second-worst hit country. But none of this comes as a surprise. India has been reporting the most daily cases in the world since early August, and has had the world’s worst-recorded case trajectory since August end. The most important figure through any pandemic, however, is the number of lives lost to it. India’s case fatality rate of 1.7% is significantly better than not only the global average of 3.2%, but also the United States and Brazil — both around 3%. This has been the primary driver of the Centre’s argument that India has handled the pandemic better than other similarly-hit nations.But despite that, more than 70,000 people have died from Covid-19. This is a significant number, and begs the question if there are things the government could have done differently to prevent the loss of lives. When the first (and hardest) lockdown shut the country down on March 25, India had 500 active cases and 10 deaths. Since then, these curbs have been gradually relaxed in seven subsequent phases. Today, when there are more than 860,000 active cases, a majority of economic activities have resumed. An argument can be made that this lockdown came in reverse order. Curbs could have been applied lightly at first, and then gradually strengthened when daily cases rose. In such a system, India would have the hardest phase of the lockdown today.But such an argument is easier to make in retrospect. In March, the world knew little about Covid-19. In a situation where experts were (and still are) learning how to fight the pandemic, a hard lockdown was one of the few concepts that had unanimous scientific backing. The government says it bought India time to strengthen its health care infrastructure, particularly in regions that needed it the most. This claim, though, will be put to the harshest test in the coming weeks. As India’s daily cases continue to set world records, the bulk of the latest infections have come from the hinterland at a time when malaria and dengue spike in these regions. Saving lives, not just in proportion of total Covid-19 cases, but also in absolute numbers, from this point will get tougher by the day, and how the government handles this will determine how well the country has truly fared against the pandemic — and how well it put the lockdown to use in terms of building health infrastructure and capacity.
The time for news channels to introspect is long overdue. News channels have a legal and moral responsibility to provide factual and informative inputs to society. Sane voices such as former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s appeal “for self-restraint” or Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu’s condemnation of “Sensationalism, yellow journalism and TRP-generating news...” have had little impact. The Delhi High Court’s humorous comment in Tharoor vs Goswami that “TV viewers who want to watch action films should (instead) watch TV debates on current affairs...” is more a cry of anguish. The nation wants to know when we will have news without the noise and content sans fiction.The toxic triangle of viewership, ratings and revenue is the catalyst driving most debates and that paradigm must be continuously stigmatised along with use of a relentless societal scissor to cut this Gordian knot. The clear line between editorial and commercial decisions, and between news and entertainment, must be restored. Uneven debates, deliberate interruptions, verbal blood sport, conscious invitation of biased and malicious participants, strategic muting of mikes, the formulation of one-sided themes and unevenly numbered viewpoints are standard tactics for driving TRP ratings and advertisement revenue. Serious news items are presented as popular crime thrillers and extremist anchors pose a potent threat to democracy. A set of reforms are now essential.One, the corruption of and connivance between TV channels and rating agencies is an open secret. For sanity in studios and on screens, an ecosystem that goes beyond this ratings-driven practice and which is citizen-centric and democratic is vital. Only the legislature can do this by inaugurating a credible, independent rating regulator.The second minimalist reform is the accountability of the media or, more importantly, the awareness and acceptance of such accountability. No freedom is absolute: Reasonable restrictions are inevitable. If progress without freedom is impossible, democracy without discipline is chaos. The courts must be quick and decisive whenever the media transgresses the Laxman rekha.In the Sahib Singh case (1965), the apex court said that journalists “have no greater freedom than others to make any imputations or allegations sufficient to ruin the reputation of a citizen…..Reckless comments are to be avoided”. The problem lies in these principles not being enforced.The third reform, industry self-regulation, was meant to be the key to maintaining standards. The News Broadcasters Association (NBA), the watchdog for visual media, has enough power to stop unethical practices. From prohibiting an anchor/presenter from making derogatory, derisive or judgmental statements to ensuring that programmes do not become a platform for spreading acrimony to controlling egregious behaviour, the regime is comprehensive and unequivocal. The problem is that these powers have not been used effectively because of a conspiracy of silence, the incestuous nature of an exclusive peer club, the chalta hai attitude and an old boys’ cartel, which seem too powerful for NBA to bust.Enforcing the ethics code and ensuring compliance is anathema to the fourth estate, at least voluntarily. But democratic spirit itself demands that media not take undue advantage of its powers. Have we seen anything like what we see in India on any British, Australian or Canadian channel or even the more aggressive American channels? The BBC and its guidelines not only mandate appropriate respect and dignity during programmes but also hold themselves accountable by law for any defamatory comments during shows. The Swiss Federal Act has similar provisions for visual programmes as does Hong Kong which ensures great accuracy and impartiality in news programmes.If the diagnosis of the disease is obvious, disciplined self-medication is the prescription. Sermons have not worked. Reliance on voluntariness has been construed as weakness and trespasses have not been visited with harsh consequences. For example, NBA has a range of powers — warn, admonish, censure, express disapproval, impose a fine upon the broadcaster and /or recommend to the concerned authority for suspension/revocation of its licence. But it has never imposed the last, and very occasionally, the penultimate penalty.As the industry’s conscience-keeper, NBA must get its teeth into the issue. Its advisories must increase and their slightest violation should evoke harsh warnings and penalties. Make an example of a few egregious violators. NBA has nothing to lose except its passivity and much to gain. A clear message sent to a few, consistently and even-handedly, will lead to a tangible and decisive change in temperature, content and direction and invite huge appreciation from the public.Abhishek Singhvi is a senior, third-term sitting MP; former chairman, Parliamentary Standing Committee; former additional solicitor general, senior national spokesperson, Congress and eminent jurist.Jaiveer Shergill is a Supreme Court lawyer and national spokesperson, Congress.The views expressed are personal
US President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign on Thursday denied a Guardian newspaper report in which a former model accused the New York real estate developer of sexually assaulting and groping her at the US Open tennis tournament in 1997.The Guardian reported that Amy Dorris told the paper in an interview that Trump assaulted her outside a bathroom in his VIP box at the tournament that year. She was 24 at the time, the newspaper said.“He just shoved his tongue down my throat and I was pushing him off. And then that’s when his grip became tighter and his hands were very gropey and all over my butt, my breasts, my back, everything,” the newspaper quoted Dorris as saying.The president’s re-election campaign on Thursday said the allegations were not true.“The allegations are totally false. We will consider every legal means available to hold The Guardian accountable for its malicious publication of this unsubstantiated story,” said Jenna Ellis, a legal advisor to Trump’s campaign.Efforts to reach Dorris by phone for comment were unsuccessful.The Guardian said in an email it stood by its reporting.The newspaper published photos that it said were provided by Dorris showing her with Trump and said that it interviewed several people who Dorris confided in at the time of the incident. It said that in total she provided six photos showing the two together as well as her ticket to the tournament on the day she said the incident occurred.Trump has faced a number of allegations of sexual misconduct prior to his time in office. Shortly before the November 2016 election an “Access Hollywood” recording from 2005 revealed him boasting about groping women. Trump dismissed the comments as “locker room banter” and apologized.Dorris, a mother of twins, told the newspaper she considered coming forward in 2016 but decided against doing so partly out of fears for her family.“Now I feel like my girls are about to turn 13 years old and I want them to know that you don’t let anybody do anything to you that you don’t want,” she said.

The Federal Reserve pledged Wednesday to keep boosting the US economy with low rates to help recover the tens of millions of jobs lost in the pandemic, but said additional help from the government will be key.Government stimulus provided in the early stages of the pandemic was “essential” to the better-than-expected progress made so far, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said, but another dose will likely be needed since the outlook remains “highly uncertain.”The Fed announcement came amid renewed optimism that the White House and Democratic leaders in Congress will reach a compromise on a new spending package, even as data showed spending gains have slowed and layoffs continue.The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee said it will keep interest rates low until it has achieved its goal of maximum employment, allowing inflation to push beyond two percent in order to spur job gains as the world’s largest economy recovers from the Covid-19 pandemic.Powell told reporters that “overall activity remains well below its level before the pandemic and the path ahead remains highly uncertain.”“It will take a while to get back to the levels of economic activity and employment that prevailed at the beginning of this year,” Powell told reporters. “My sense is that more fiscal support is likely to be needed.”He noted that roughly 11 million people are still out of work due to the pandemic and as many were working in industries that are likely to struggle, “those people may need additional support.”Small businesses also continue to struggle, while state and local governments dealing with a drop in revenue at the same time spending has gone up, he said.The median GDP forecast among the 17 FOMC members reflect the better-than-expected US recovery, and they now see the economy contracting by only 3.7 percent this year, compared to 6.5 percent drop expected in June.However, growth expectations for 2021 and 2022 were more modest than previously.US unemployment has fallen to 8.4 percent from its peak of 14.7 percent in April amid the most widespread pandemic business shutdowns, and the FOMC members’ median forecast is for the jobless rate to end the year at 7.6 percent and drop to 5.5 percent by the end of next year.“The labor market has been recovering but it’s a long way from maximum unemployment,” Powell said.More aidPowell, whose pleas have become increasingly urgent, said it is up to Congress to decide what form the aid will take.Talks in Washington on a new bill to aid both workers and businesses hit by the coronavirus downturn have stalled for weeks, but Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows each made encouraging statements about the potential to break the impasse.That message was quickly undermined by President Donald Trump, who renewed his attacks on Democrats while cheering a CNBC personality who called Pelosi “Crazy Nancy” in a live broadcast.“Democrats are ‘heartless’. They don’t want to give STIMULUS PAYMENTS to people who desperately need the money, and whose fault it was NOT that the plague came in from China,” Trump said on Twitter. “Go for the much higher numbers, Republicans, it all comes back to the USA anyway (one way or another!).”Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer slapped back at Trump but applauded his apparent call for more help.“By the end of the week, 200,000 Americans will have died from the coronavirus. The lives and livelihoods of the American people depend on Republicans abandoning their obsession with doing as little as possible while the coronavirus rages through our nation,” they said in a joint statement.Policy shiftThe Fed statement reaffirmed the policy shift that Powell announced last month, which means the central bank will keep rates low to return to maximum employment allowing inflation to heat up and hold above the two percent target for an extended period.The new forecasts also show central bankers expect rates will stay at zero at least through 2023, while inflation is does not even reach two percent until the end of that year.However, two FOMC members dissented in the vote, one indicating the policy might go too far, and the other that it was not aggressive enough.
West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Saturday said that the state has become a ‘home of illegal bomb-making’ and lashed out at the law enforcement agencies for the decline in law and order in the state.Dhankhar tweeted, “State has become home to illegal bomb making that has potential to unsettle democracy. Police @MamataOfficial busy in carrying out political errands and taking on opposition. Those at helm @WBPolice cannot escape their accountability for this alarming decline in law and order.”State has become home to illegal bomb making that has potential to unsettle democracy.Police @MamataOfficial busy in carrying out political errands and taking on opposition.Those at helm @WBPolice cannot escape their accountability for this alarming decline in law and order. — Governor West Bengal Jagdeep Dhankhar (@jdhankhar1) September 19, 2020He appealed to the law enforcement agencies to not escape accountability. Dhankhar’s comments came after the National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested 9 individuals from West Bengal’s Murshidabad and Kerala’s Ernakulam for their association with a Pakistan-sponsored module of the al-Qaeda on Saturday.How far distanced is DGP @WBPolice from reality is cause of worry. His ‘Ostrich Stance’ is very disturbing.Appreciate role of policemen in general-they r working in difficult situations. Problem is with those at helm who r unmindful of conduct and r politically guided. — Governor West Bengal Jagdeep Dhankhar (@jdhankhar1) September 19, 2020The governor also wrote on Twitter that the West Bengal’s director general of police is holding an ‘ostrich stance’ and is unaware of the ground reality. Dhankhar said he understands the constraints of the policemen who are working under the shadow of the pandemic but highlighted that people at the ‘helm are unmindful of conduct and are politically guided’.Two people died in west Midnapore district in south Bengal on Thursday as crude bombs were hurled when two groups of miscreants clashed with each other. In August, a Trinamool Congress worker died while making crude bombs in Shamsergunj area of Bengal’s Murshidabad district. Murshidabad’s Suti also reported two deaths and five injuries in July associated with crude bomb making.
It was a night Dr. Bassam Osman says changed his life. At around 6 p.m. on Aug. 4, the 27-year-old surgical resident was about to leave his daily hospital shift. Then a massive explosion shook Beirut.The floodgates opened and hundreds of wounded poured into the American University of Beirut Medical Center, one of Lebanon’s best hospitals.The medical staff of around 100 doctors, nurses and aides juggled priorities and space in treating the torn-up and bloodied men, women and children. They sutured wounds by mobile phone lights when electricity conked out. The wounded kept streaming in because several other hospitals closer to the port were knocked out of service by the blast.Veteran doctors who had worked through Lebanon’s civil war said they’d never seen anything like it. In six hours, they used up a year and a half’s worth of emergency supplies.Osman ended up working the next 52 hours straight. He treated more than two dozen patients. He lost one.“There was no moment in my life where I felt more in touch with my own and my surrounding humanity,” Osman said of those 52 hours in a tweet afterward.Osman, at the beginning of his career, finds himself in a medical field far different from what he expected when he entered the profession.Lebanon’s health facilities were once considered among the region’s best. In a short time, they have been brought to near collapse, battered by Lebanon’s financial meltdown and a surge in coronavirus cases, then smashed by the Beirut explosion.But the blast has also given Osman a greater sense of duty. That day’s trauma, he says, forged a deeper emotional bond between doctors and patients, left with no one else to trust in a country where politicians and public institutions take no responsibility.The disaster, caused by explosive chemicals left untended for years at Beirut’s port, has stoked anger at Lebanon’s corrupt officials, who are also blamed for driving the country of 5 million into near bankruptcy. More than 190 people were killed in the explosion, thousands hurt, and tens of thousands of homes were wrecked.“Day by day, these (crises) are becoming our normal life,” Osman told the AP. “We are tired... It feels like one long marathon.”Harder days may be ahead, he feels.The blast exacerbated shortages in medical supplies caused by the financial crisis. Replacement supplies are not coming fast enough.In one of Osman’s recent operations, lack of supplies nearly turned a small but critical procedure into invasive surgery. Osman and the other surgeons didn’t have the right size balloon to expand the patient’s arteries and were about to open her chest, before they found a way to improvise a replacement.Medical facilities hit by the economic meltdown are laying off staff. More doctors are emigrating. Osman’s salary, denominated in Lebanese pounds, dropped in value from nearly $1,300 to just around $200 a month because of the local currency’s crash.It will cost nearly $30 million to repair health facilities damaged by the blast, the World Health Organization estimates. Eight hospitals and 20 clinics sustained partial or heavy structural damage. Two hospitals remain largely out of service. One, deemed totally unsafe, has to be leveled and rebuilt.The blast damaged the WHO’s main warehouse for medical supplies, destroying a shipment of Covid-19 protective equipment. It destroyed a Covid-19 isolation center used for migrant workers and vulnerable groups, and damaged centers for HIV and tuberculosis.The strained health system faces a coronavirus surge. Since the Aug. 4 blast, there has been a 220% increase in reported infections, according to the International Rescue Committee.Covid-19 patients are filling hospital and ICU beds. More than 25,000 confirmed cases have been reported, and 8% of all tests are coming back positive, according to the lead Covid-19 doctor Firas Abiad. More than 250 people have died. The number is expected to rise, with 115 patients in ICU, up from single digits before July.The increase is partly due to the explosion’s after-effects, including overcrowding in health facilities, displaced people sheltering with family and friends, and disrupted water networks and loss of hygiene items, said Christina Bethke, a WHO coordinator of the emergency response.Hit by the financial crisis, many cannot afford medical treatment. In the weeks preceding the explosion, Osman said he and his colleagues thought things had hit their worst when they saw people leaving the hospital because they couldn’t pay for admission.Then the blast came.Osman can’t forget the patient he lost that day.The young man came in with a hole in his heart and was whisked to the operating room. When the hole was closed, the team noticed bleeding in the abdomen and tended to that. But he also had a brain hemorrhage. In the chaos, the doctors had no time for imaging to detect it. The patient died.Osman knows only the first digits of his medical number: Patient AAA. He’s trying to find out his identity — at least his name, or where he was when the blast went off, or whether he has family looking for him.“I feel like I need to find closure for this operation, especially because we tried so hard,” he said.Since the blast, there is a new “intensity of emotion” between doctors and patients, Osman said.One woman reached out to Osman on social media, seeking advice for a plastic surgeon because her wounds were stitched badly on the day of the blast — not realizing he was the one who did the stitching.Osman admitted responsibility, saying the sutures were done under mobile phone lights. He invited her to return. She did, for coffee. He got to apologize in person, and she, in an Instagram post, thanked him for “putting her back together” and saving her life.Osman called it one of the most rewarding and heartwarming experiences.Another difference: Patients want to talk. Needing to unburden themselves, they talk about how they lost their homes, what happened to them in the blast, how they can’t afford treatment — “then they start talking about the whole situation in the country,” he said.“People can trust us, not only with their health but also their emotions ... I think the emotional injury is much more severe than the physical one,” he said.Osman said he welcomes it. “I try to make it personal with patients,” he said. “I’m not here just to do my job and leave.”Osman has two more years in his residency, then he plans to go on a fellowship abroad. He said that previously it was “a question mark” whether he would return to Lebanon when it was over.After the explosion, he is certain he will.“After I witnessed how much potential there is to give as a doctor in a country like Lebanon ... I realized that the question marks have all gone away.”
Some teachers of Delhi University Tuesday approached the Delhi High Court seeking direction to the colleges which are affiliated to the varsity and fully funded by the AAP government to release their salaries pending for the last four months.The petition, which is likely to come up for hearing on September 17, said apart from these teachers there are other employees, teaching and non-teaching staff, who have not received their salaries for the months of May, June, July and August.The eight teachers, who have filed the plea through advocates Ashok Agarwal and Kumar Utkarsh, said they are members of Delhi University Teachers Association (DUTA), which on behalf of the aggrieved staff, has been writing to the Delhi government for release of funds to enable the 12 DU colleges, funded by the AAP government, to pay due salaries to 1500 teachers and non-teaching staff working there.The plea said due to non-payment of salaries to the teachers, they and all other employees working with the 12 colleges are undergoing mental agony and harassment and contended that there is no justification on the part of authorities to not pay them their dues on time.“The impugned actions are unjust, unfair, arbitrary, discriminatory, unethical, unconstitutional, violative of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India read with the provisions of Delhi University Act, 1922.“The impugned actions are bad in law as much as the same is violative of right to life as well as right to livelihood as guaranteed under Article 21 of Constitution of India,” the plea contended.It sought direction to the authorities to pay salaries to the petitioners due from May this year till date and also ensure timely payment of salaries in future.The plea said the 12 colleges which are affiliated with the Delhi University and are fully funded by the Delhi government are Acharya Narendra Dev College, Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar College, Bhaskaracharya College of Applied Sciences, Bhagini Nivedita College, DeenDayal Upadhyaya College, Aditi Mahavidyalaya Women’s College, Indira Gandhi Institute of Physical Education & Sports Sciences, Keshav Mahavidyalaya, Maharaja Agrasen College (DU), Maharshi Valmiki College of Education, Shaheed Rajguru College of Applied Sciences for Women and Shaheed Sukhdev College of Business Studies.

he All India Handloom Board rarely met and was thus disbanded, said Union minister for textiles Smriti Irani on Friday in Parliament, adding that it also did not contribute to policy formulation.The minister said the decision to disband the board was taken based after a thorough review of its functioning.“The assessment revealed that weavers from across the Nation did not benefit from the Board which barely met, and did not take weavers across all states into confidence. There was no contribution from the Board as regards policy formulation and its implementation,” Irani said in a written reply.“On the other hand, the Weavers’ Service Centres and the State Handloom departments have been working well in good coordination through interactions on policy, implementation of Government schemes, educating weavers about online marketing platforms including efforts to onboard weavers on Government e-marketplace (GeM), and addressing the problems of handloom weavers through Chaupals,” she added.The Textile Ministry decided to scrap the All India Handloom Board with effect from July 27 and the Handicrafts Board on August 3 to “ensure a leaner government machinery”, sparking controversy after the Central government ran a massive social media campaign celebrating National Handloom Day on August 7.Craft activist and one of the founders of Dastkar, a society for craftspeople, Laila Tyabji took to Facebook to talk about the board, which gave a chance to artisans to directly engage with government policy.“All these years on, it remained the one official forum, however watered down, where the voices and views of weavers and craftspeople could be expressed directly. One place where representatives of the sector were present in considerable numbers, and were actually empowered to advise the government in policy and sectoral spending,” Tyabji said.According to a gazette notification issued by the ministry and accessed by Hindustan Times, the Boards were scrapped ‘in consonance with the Government of India vision of ‘Minimum Government and Maximum Governance’.“A leaner Government Machinery and the need for systematic rationalization of Government bodies, the Government of India has abolished All India Handloom Board with effect from the date of issue of this resolution,” states the notification.Officials in the ministry said that this was just the first step in a massive churn-taking place to reduce the expenditure of the ministry and get rid of redundant boards and organizational units.
Updated: Sep 14, 2020 14:49 ISTThe markings of a rollercoaster year are plastered over Sutiwet’s small Jakarta restaurant – plastic barriers on the counters, stickers on the glass urging customers to wear masks, and a gallon of water out front for people to wash their hands.But just as life in the Indonesian capital was starting to return to normal, the city’s 10 million residents are heading into partial lockdown for the second time.Jakarta’s tightened social restrictions, effective from Monday for two weeks, mean businesses, malls and houses of worship can only operate at limited capacity, while dining in at restaurants and cafes is not allowed.Small business owners such as Sutiwet, who like many Indonesians goes by only one name, are bracing themselves for the economic impact.“We almost managed to survive the first round of large-scale social restrictions, and here comes another one,” Sutiwet, 45, told Reuters.“For now, I am relieved that we are almost surviving, but it will definitely have an impact on income.”The second round of social restrictions, known locally as “PSBB”, comes amid a spike in COVID-19 cases and as Jakarta’s 67 designated coronavirus hospitals near full capacity.The capital has recorded a daily average of more than 1,000 new cases this month, with 43,400 cases in total and 1,330 deaths since March, according to government data.Months into the pandemic businesses are feeling the crunch, said Shinta Khamdani, from the Indonesian employers’ association.“This (PSBB) policy is very deadly for us, depressing demand so much so that there is no driver for businesses to improve our economic performance,” said Khamdani. “Right now, businesses are desperately trying to maintain their existence.”If social restrictions are implemented long term, many small and medium enterprises would not survive, she said.With more than 218,000 coronavirus cases nationally, Indonesia’s government has the difficult challenge of balancing health and economic concerns, as the country faces a recession in the third quarter.Heading to work on Monday, Lila Pratiwi, 34, said she was trying to adapt.“Public transportation is my biggest concern, the government should pay attention as most of the new clusters are from offices and public transport,” she said. “That’s why I decided to walk today.”
Updated: Sep 19, 2020 17:41 ISTChina’s economy remains resilient and there are ample policy tools at Beijing’s disposal despite rising external risks, President Xi Jinping said in remarks published on Saturday.The world’s second-largest economy has steadily recovered from a virus-induced slump, but analysts say policymakers face a tough job to maintain stable expansion over the next several years to turn China into a high-income nation.“The basic characteristics of China’s economy with sufficient potential, great resilience, strong vitality, large space for manoeuvre and many policy instruments have not changed,” Xinhua news agency quoted Xi as saying.China has strong manufacturing capacity, very large domestic markets and huge investment potentials, Xi said.Xi reaffirmed a “dual circulation” strategy that would help steer the economy towards greater self-reliance, as US hostility and a global pandemic increase external risks.China still enjoyed “strategic opportunities” in its development, although the coronavirus pandemic has exacerbated global challenges as globalisation slows and unilateralism and protectionism are rising, Xi was quoted as saying at a meeting on the country’s 14th five-year plan (2021-2025).“We must seek our development in a more unstable and uncertain world,” he said.Xi urged calmness amid rising difficulties and challenges.“The great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation can never be achieved easily with the beating of gongs and drums,” he said.
In 2020, the world has been hit by an unprecedented public health crisis, with the effects of Covid-19 being felt across every aspect of people’s lives. This year also marks the 75th anniversary of the signing of the Charter of the United Nations (UN). Now more than ever, the global community must make a concerted effort to forge the better and more sustainable future called for by UN and its member-states. Taiwan is ready, willing and able to be a part of these efforts.With less than 500 confirmed cases and seven deaths, Taiwan has defied predictions and successfully contained the pandemic. This has all come in no small part due to Taiwan’s quick response measures, including the establishment of a Central Epidemic Command Centre, the implementation of stringent border controls and quarantine procedures, and transparent information-sharing. And after making sure we had enough supplies to look after our people, we started providing medical equipment and supplies to other countries in serious need.By the end of June, Taiwan had donated 51 million surgical masks, 1.16 million N95 masks, 600,000 isolation gowns, 35,000 forehead thermometers, and other medical material to more than 80 countries, including India, the United States (US), Taiwan’s diplomatic allies, and various European nations. We have also joined forces with like-minded democracies to explore the development of rapid test kits, medicines, and vaccines. Working together for the greater good is how the world will defeat Covid-19.In the Declaration on the Commemoration of the 75th anniversary of UN, governments and heads of States acknowledged that only by working together in solidarity can we end the pandemic and effectively tackle its consequences. They thus pledged to make UN more inclusive and to leave no one behind as the world looks to recover from the pandemic.Similarly, in July, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said that networked, inclusive, and effective multilateralism would aid global efforts to promote recovery and the continued implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We could not agree more. However, this vision seems lacking when Taiwan — one of the world’s model democracies and a success story in containing the current pandemic — continues to be barred from taking part in and exchanging experiences and information with UN system. Not having Taiwan’s input in UN is a loss to the global community, and will hamper member-states’ efforts to regain normalcy and implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in full and on time.Even as the pandemic has made the international community aware of Taiwan’s unjust and discriminatory exclusion from the World Health Organization and the UN system, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) continues to press UN to use an erroneous interpretation of the 1971 UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 (XXVI) as the legal basis for blocking Taiwan.The fact is that this resolution does not address the issue of Taiwan’s representation in UN, nor does it state that Taiwan is part of PRC. In fact, Taiwan is not, nor has it ever been, a part of the PRC. Our president and legislature are directly elected by the people of Taiwan. Moreover, border controls instituted during the pandemic offer further evidence to counter PRC’s false claims. UN must recognise that only Taiwan’s democratically-elected government can represent its 23.5 million people; PRC has no right to speak on Taiwan’s behalf.Unfortunately, the 23.5 million people of Taiwan are denied any access to UN premises. Taiwanese journalists and media outlets are also denied accreditation to cover UN meetings. This discriminatory policy stems from the wrongful claims of and pressure from an authoritarian state, and contravenes the principle of universality and equality upon which UN was founded.The UN Charter begins with “We the peoples of the United Nations determined . . . to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights . . . [and] the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small”. The ideal of upholding human rights and fundamental freedoms for all laid out in this text must not remain empty words. As it looks ahead to the next 75 years, it is never too late for the UN to welcome Taiwan’s participation.Dr Jaushieh Joseph Wu is Minister of Foreign Affairs, Republic of China (Taiwan)The views expressed are personal
India’s GDP contracted by 23.9% in the quarter ending June 2020. The government has argued that a V-shaped recovery is underway in the economy. But almost all institutional and private forecasts do not support this claim. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) expects the Indian economy to contract by 9% in 2020-21. ADB had projected a 4% contraction in June. On September 14, S&P projected a contraction of 9% for the economy, from its earlier forecast of a 5% contraction.Most experts also warn that even the sequential recovery in the economy cannot be taken for granted. The Nomura India Business Resumption Index (NIBRI) reached its highest post-lockdown level in the week ending September 13. However, the Nomura report raises questions on its sustainability given the continuous rise in Covid-19 infections. In addition, rising inflation poses another challenge to economic recovery. Headline retail inflation clocked a 6.7% growth in August, making it the fifth consecutive month when inflation was above the upper bound of Reserve Bank of India (RBI)’s comfort level. Food prices and necessary services such as transport and communication are driving up inflation, even as the market for mass consumption goods such as apparel continues to be weak. Consumers are clearly facing a double whammy of squeeze on incomes and job losses along with a rise in price of essential commodities and services. And till this situation is reversed, the economy, across sectors, and citizens, across age groups, regions and classes, will suffer.Given these disconcerting facts, many — including this newspaper — have suggested a fiscal stimulus to boost economic activity. However, the fact that the supplementary demand for grant moved on the first day of monsoon session asked for a net additional spending of ₹1.67 lakh crore suggests that there are no immediate plans for another stimulus. To be sure, the government has not ruled one out. In July, the chief economic adviser said that the second round of stimulus might be timed when the Covid-19 vaccine becomes available. What needs to be understood, however, is the fact that delaying the stimulus might make things worse. Unless there is a focused intervention in the economy, both business and consumer sentiment will continue to deteriorate, eclipsing prospects of any credible recovery.
English cricketers “have not forgotten” the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement,” assured pacer Jofra Archer, responding to Micheal Holding’s criticism of his side which did not take a knee before matches against Australia and Pakistan. West Indies fast bowing great Holding did not appreciate that fact that England have now stopped taking a knee during matches. The BLM is a political and social movement, advocating non-violent civil disobedience in protest against incidents of police brutality and racially motivated violence against black people.“We have not forgotten, no one here has forgotten about Black Lives Matter,” Archer was quoted as saying by Sky Sports. “I think it is a bit harsh for Michael Holding to not do some research before criticising. I’m pretty sure he doesn’t know what is going on behind the scenes.“I don’t think he has spoken to (CB chief executive) Tom Harrison. I have spoken to Tom and we have stuff running in the background,” the Barbados-born England fast bowler said but did not specify what it was.Having faced slurs for missing England’s second Test against the West Indies for bio-secure breach in July this year, Archer urged social media platforms to extinguish racial abuse. “I think a lot of stuff is being put into place now,” said Archer, who was subjected to racial abuse by a spectator during England’s tour of New Zealand last year.“People can be prosecuted a bit easier, though I think it may have to go a bit further as some people are still a bit worried of what could happen to them.“As long as there is social media and the person doesn’t have to confront you I think it will still go on. All we can do is try and act accordingly, report it and do what’s best.”Archer, adjudged man-of-the-match for his 3 for 34 figures in the second ODI against Australia, said he is strong enough to deal with such an issue, but is worried about mentally fragile people.“I think I am strong enough to deal with it but what happens when they start targeting someone who is not as mentally strong and it starts affecting them? We have to try and stamp it out as much as possible,” he said.“I saw one lady comment about my chain but chains have nothing to do with cricket and if she knew me she would know I have had my chain since I was 14 or 15. You can’t make everyone happy but the majority are happy and that makes me happy,” the 25-year-old cricketer said.
Updated: Sep 17, 2020 11:37 ISTMuch like her fellow colleagues, actor Kavita Kaushik, too, is angered to see the way people are jumping the gun in Sushant Singh Rajput death case. ,Asserting that one should let law take its course and investigation to continue smoothly, the actor is against the agenda-driven conversations that are happening around the case.“Humein dukh hona chahiye ki jo gaya woh kabhi wapas nahi aayega. Par hum to apne baki cheezon mein lagey pade hain. It’s been over two months and I’m worried if a case of a superstar is taking this long to reach a conclusion, how much anyone of us can suffer if something like this happen to us,” wonders Kaushik.She also points how narratives have been shifting from one subject to another further complicating the case.“It started from mental health, then nepotism, insider-outsider debate and now it’s drugs. This case is going everywhere, but reaching a conclusion. Kya hamara dhyan baki aur zazoori cheezon se hataya ja raha hai? This case is being politicised right now,” says Kaushik.Looking at the toxic trolling, mud-slinging, blame game and name calling on social media, Kaushik feels it;s doing no good but adding fuel to the fire.“Social media is the worst drug. Look at the language, threats, abuses being hurled at people and random judgements being passed. Everyone is saying something or the other and changing their words to suit their vested interest. Koi bolta hai Mumbai safe nahi hai, koi kuch aur bol raha hai. We all must protest, seek justice. I also want to know what happened with Sushant but what is this circus happening?” questions the actor.Meanwhile, given how the entertainment industry is anyway going through a rough patch with shoots being affected due to the pandemic, Kaushik is looking forward to resume work, but not for the sake of it. She isn’t in any rush to take up just anything that comes her way.“I’d rather sit at home and play with my cats than be a part of supernatural shows or shows portraying typical Indian women whose entire life revolves around their kitchen. After doing a show like FIR for eight years, I don’t want to be a part of any regressive content. No one has yet offered me anything reasonably interesting, which would coerce me to get ready with my sanitisers, 10 packs of masks, and get going,” she tells us.Asked about the virus scare and the fact that many cast and crew members on several shows have tested positive, is she still comfortable stepping out for work?Kaushik admits that though all these news have made her cautious, she is all for work to continue with all necessary precautions in place.“How are we forgetting that the government have requested us to be responsible in going atmanirbhar for survival? Forget wearing masks, many aren’t even following social distancing norms. Public gatherings are happening every other day. It’s strange that fingers are always being pointed towards the entertainment industry. Why are cases reported on sets of shows being highlighted, while people flouting Covid-19 norms ignored? In fact, TV shoots are happening in a systematic way by following precautions. Let them do their work please,” she concludes.Author tweets @Shreya_MJ
Updated: Sep 18, 2020 23:39 ISTThe Vishva Hindu Parishad on Friday welcomed Iqbal Ansari’s statement in which he had issued an appeal to the CBI court to acquit all the 32 accused in the Babri Masjid demolition case in the larger interest of the Hindu-Muslim unity. A key Muslim litigant in the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid title suit, Ansari’s father Hashim Ansari was the oldest litigant in the title suit.On September 30, the special CBI court will deliver its final verdict in the criminal cases linked to the mosque’s demolition in 1992.Senior Bharatiya Janata Party leaders LK Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Kalyan Singh and Uma Bharti are among the 32 accused.“We welcome Iqbal Ansari’s statement. The Supreme Court has ruled in favour of Ram Mandir. In such a scenario, the Babri Masjid demolition case must be dropped,” said Sharad Sharma, regional spokesperson, VHP.“Ansari’s statement is in the larger interest of the nation. After the Supreme Court’s verdict in favour of Ram Mandir, all issues related to dispute must end,” Sharma added.Raju Das, priest of Hanuman Garhi, has also welcomed Ansari’s statement.On November 9 last year, the apex court paved the way for construction of the Ram temple at the 2.77 acre site in Ayodhya. The court also ordered the government to allot land at an alternative site for a mosque.Ansari was among three Muslim invitees for the ground-breaking ceremony of the Ram temple on August 5 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Mohammad Sharif from Ayodhya and Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board chairman Zufar Ahmed Farooqui of Lucknow were also invited but only Ansari attended the ceremony.Ansari was also against the All India Muslim Personal Law Board’s decision to file a review petition against the top court’s Ayodhya verdict. The Supreme Court dismissed all review petitions in December last year.
Filmmaker Pooja Bhatt has spoken up in support of actor Urmila Matondkar, who was verbally attacked by Kangana Ranaut in a Wednesday interview. Kangana had called Urmila a ‘soft porn star’ who ‘isn’t known for her acting’.On Twitter, Pooja wrote, “@UrmilaMatondkar you are a legend. #Rangeela was a treat visually,emotionally and you raised the bar for all of us in so many ways. You left us all,co-actors and an entire generation of movie goers awestruck! Sensuality & dignity.. two qualities you combined & embodied. Respect!”@UrmilaMatondkar you are a legend. #Rangeela was a treat visually,emotionally and you raised the bar for all of us in so many ways. You left us all,co-actors and an entire generation of movie goers awestruck! Sensuality & dignity.. two qualities you combined & embodied. Respect! — Pooja Bhatt (@PoojaB1972) September 17, 2020Pooja’s statement comes a day after Kangana, in an interview to Times Now, lashed out at Urmila, who had questioned her motives in the ongoing drugs controversy. Kangana had called Urmila a ‘soft porn star’ who is ‘not known for her acting, for sure.’ The comment was condemned by several Bollywood personalities.In an earlier interview to India Today, Urmila had said, “The entire country is facing the menace of drugs. Does she (Kangana) know Himachal is the origin of drugs? She should start from her own state.”Pooja had also commented on the ongoing drugs controversy in Bollywood, which began during actor Rhea Chakraborty’s investigation and subsequent arrest in connection to Sushant Singh Rajput’s death. Rhea has been charged with procuring drugs for the late actor, and is currently lodged in Byculla Jail. Pooja had written on Twitter earlier, “Does anyone care about people who live on the ultimate fringe of society,who use drugs to make the pain of living go away? The ones who are too battered & broken to chase dreams but chase substances amidst much poverty & squalor? Anyone interested in their rehabilitation?”Kangana, who has alleged that 99% of the film industry has been exposed to drugs, was also involved in a recent war of words with Samajwadi Party MP Jaya Bachchan.
In May, the now banned app TikTok’s review on the app store bombed from four stars to one star. The reason behind it was the 21-year-old YouTuber, Ajey Nagar aka Carry Minati. His roast video, titled YouTube Vs TikTok - The End, almost became the most liked non-music video on YouTube in India in 24 hours. It was later taken down by the video sharing platform, alleging it of cyber bullying and abusive language. But Minati doesn’t agree. “I do not support any kind of cyber bullying, trolling, abuse and harassment, and I have disclaimers. I do get shocked when people react to my videos as a form of harassment, because that’s a total disrespect to my art. My passion isn’t built on any form of exploitation,” says Minati.The journey to finding his passion started at the age of 10, when he started posting videos on YouTube. He found his passion in 2015, when he came up with the moniker Carry Deol, posting videos of him playing a video game, while mimicking actor Sunny Deol. It then became Carry Minati, as he started “roasting” other people and that’s when the then 17-year-old probably took the biggest decision in his life. He chose not to give his class XII board exam for Economics, dropped out of school and decided to make videos for a living!“I am not a person who lives by the rule book and my heart always dominates the head! I’m glad I took the leap of faith, as no degree could have ever earned me the respect and the love, I enjoy today by giving audiences an escape route from commonplace monotony!” he says.In about four years, with over 25 million subscribers on his channel CarryMinati, it looks like he has made the right decision. He the most subscribed individual creator on YouTube India.“I don’t look at all these numbers because I know when you go up, you go down, too. It does add a lot of pressure. But I believe responsibility doesn’t need to be uninteresting and stereotyped.You can be spirited and yet make an impact! I finally feel that with the love and support of my fans the views expressed by me are given some weightage,” he shares.But as Minati himself points out, “social media is such a volatile playground where every word can be misconstrued,” especially in the case of comedy roasts. Not only because they are often brutal and extremely personal, but also because Minati feels it is a “new concept” in India. But he believes that it will “be full blown in the next decade as sensibilities become more cosmopolitan.”“You can’t always expect people to say nice things about you, you need to be a sport when the bad things come your way, because everyone will have an opinion that you may not like. I mean I was roasted a hundred times before I even took this profession up seriously and I took all of it in my stride,” he says.“A lot of people might not know but I regularly get requests from various people to roast them and funnily the people I roast are not as offended and disturbed as the haters who react to the roasts,” adds Minati. Amir Siddiqui, a former Tik-Tok user, who was roasted by Minati in the now-deleted video, had considered it to be an “honour” to have been roasted by the latter.So, Minati “takes criticism in a healthy manner” and tries to “improvise”. However, at times, it does “disturb” him, especially when the criticism “is out of context or based on assumptions”. But, he puts that frustration to good use. The anger he felt after his video was deleted made him release Yalgaar, which now holds the record for most number of likes for a video on the platform. “[After my video was deleted] I stayed confined in my room for days and bottled up the angst. When the volcano erupted inside me, Yalgaar was born,” says Minati.Despite all the accusations, Minati doesn’t regret the decision he took four years ago. And while he admits he does miss “the regular college life and hanging out with friends on campus”, he is happy he made a “bold” decision. “If I had to continue dwelling in the past crying over bygones, I’d never be half as successful as I am today. I am happy I made a bold decision and an informed choice for myself at such a young age,” he says singing off on the note that “Some of the biggest business tycoons are school and college drop outs!”Interact with the author on Twitter/@sammysamarth

Symptoms that prompted the University of Oxford and partner AstraZeneca to pause trials evaluating their experimental coronavirus vaccine probably weren’t related to the shot itself, according to documents sent to participants.Safety reviews were carried out when volunteers in the Oxford study developed unexplained neurological symptoms including limb weakness or “changed sensation”, a participant information sheet posted online by Oxford shows.“After independent review, these illnesses were either considered unlikely to be associated with the vaccine or there was insufficient evidence to say for certain that the illnesses were or were not related to the vaccine,” the letter reads. “In each of these cases, after considering the information, the independent reviewers recommended that vaccinations should continue.”The details shed more light on an episode reported last week in the UK trial and the safety data that triggered the halt. AstraZeneca and Oxford have continued to face questions about the event, and their vaccine study remains on hold in the US pending a regulatory review, federal officials said. It’s the first indication from Oxford as to the nature of the illness, which sparked concerns about vaccine safety.AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot had said earlier that it wasn’t clear whether the participant had a condition called transverse myelitis, after news reports cited it as a suspected diagnosis. US National Institutes of Health director Francis Collins told a Senate committee last week that the trial had been halted due to a spinal cord problem.In rare move, Moderna shares its trial protocolUS biotech firm Moderna, one of two companies holding phase 3 trials in the US for a Covid-19 vaccine, took the unusual step on Thursday of publishing its trial protocols after calls for more transparency. Moderna said it had recruited 25,296 participants of its goal of 30,000, of whom 28% were from minority communities.
Sonet HTE is the base trim and those on an extremely tight budget would be eyeing this option. Its price is already mentioned above.Sonet HTK is priced from ₹7.59 lakh, HTK+ is priced at ₹8.45 lakh, HTX and HTX+ start at ₹9.99 lakh and ₹11.65 lakh, respectively. The Sonet GTX+ is getting the maximum traction since pre-launch bookings were opened. Its pricing has been kept at ₹11.99 lakh.Kia Sonet's detailed price list:The Kia Sonet starts from ₹ 6.71 lakh and stretches up to ₹ 11.99 lakh.So how does Kia Sonet measure up in terms of pricing against the enormously popular Hyundai Venue?Kia Sonet is the latest kid on the block in the sub-compact SUV segment.Venue starts at a price point of ₹6.75 lakh for the E petrol variant. Next in line is S petrol which has a price tag of ₹7.45 lakh while E diesel is next in the price ascendancy order at ₹8.14 lakh. S Plus petrol is priced at ₹8.36 lakh while S Turbo petrol - a popular choice - has an asking price of ₹8.51 lakh. S Diesel is next and one will have to pay ₹9.05 lakh.Hyundai Venue Sport offers a more striking look courtesy cosmetic additions in red accents all around. (Photo: Sabyasachi Dasgupta/HTAuto)The first auto transmission option in the Venue comes in the S Turbo DCT which is priced at ₹9.65 lakh. Then there is the SX Turbo petrol manual priced at ₹9.84 lakh. The dual tone version is ₹10,000 more expensive.iMT is a popular choice for convenient driving option as it does not have a clutch while it retains the gearbox. SX Sport iMT is priced at ₹10.25 lakh.From here on the pricing structure of Venue is as follows:SX Diesel Sport manual diesel - ₹10.30 lakhSX Dual Tone manual diesel - ₹10.35 lakhSX Opt Turbo manual petrol - ₹10.90 lakhSX Opt iMT petrol - ₹11.20 lakhSX Opt Turbo DT manual petrol - ₹11.25 lakhSX Opt manual diesel - ₹11.46 lakhSX Opt Sport manual diesel - ₹11.52 lakhSX Plus Turbo DCT DT auto petrol - ₹11.63 lakh.While the huge number of variants and trims on both Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue can get a bit intimidating for new buyers, it is important to note here that while Sonet starts around the same price point as the Venue, it is the Hyundai top-end that has the slight advantage when it comes to the price at the absolute top diesel variant vs Sonet GTX+ diesel manual and GTX+ petrol iMT . That said, the feature list on the top-end Sonet is even more exhaustive than on the Venue and those looking at getting their hands behind a brand new wheel would likely prefer the newer Korean sibling.(All prices are ex showroom and for reference.

Three companies will launch initial public offerings (IPOs) worth ₹3,160 crore next week, hoping to benefit from an equity market awash with liquidity and a sharp increase in new retail investors.Indian stocks have rebounded more than 50% from their lows in March when the government imposed one of the world’s strictest lockdowns to contain Covid-19. This rally has ended a long spell of dry primary markets this year with three major IPOs since the outbreak witnessing strong subscriptions.“There is a flush of IPOs from mid-sized firms to take advantage of the buoyant market conditions and a significant rise in retail participation. More importantly, there is a willingness to pay premium valuation to firms with differentiated business models and a reputed management team,” said Gaurav Dua, senior VP and head of capital market strategy and investments, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.Two issues will open for subscription on Monday: Computer Age Management Services (CAMS) and Chemcon Speciality Chemicals Ltd, followed by Angel Broking on Tuesday.The CAMS IPO will be open for subscription on 21-23 September at a price band of ₹1,229-1,230 per share. Existing shareholder NSE Investments Ltd is looking to sell its entire stake through the offering, which will fetch it ₹2,242 crore at the upper end of the band.With a price band of ₹338-340 per share, the share sale of Chemcon will be open for subscription during 21-23 September. The specialty chemicals company aims to raise ₹318 crore at the upper end of the band.Riding on the strong wave of retail investors, Angel Broking will seek to raise as much as ₹600 crore through its three-day IPO that will close on 24 September.The price band has been fixed at ₹305-306 apiece.Huge listing gains seen in all the stock market listings in the last few months have lured investors, resulting in IPOs seeing heavy subscriptions.Shares of Happiest Minds Technologies Ltd more than doubled on their debut on Thursday. The stock soared 138% over its issue price on the first day itself. The ₹702-crore IPO was subscribed 151 times last week. The ₹600 crore issue of Route Mobile, which was subscribed 73 times, will list on Monday.
A plea has been filed in the Supreme Court challenging the Jharkhand High Court order which had dismissed a petition seeking quashing of a notice issued by the National Law School of India University (NLSIU), Benguluru, regarding holding of separate entrance examination NLAT-2020. The high court had on September 11 rejected a plea against the notice issued by NLSIU Benguluru which had declared that a separate examination for admission to its five years BA LLB (Hons.) programme would be held on September 12.The apex court had on September 11 given its go ahead to NLSIU Bengaluru to hold its separate entrance examination but had restrained it from announcing the results and admitting any student till the pendency of the plea. The top court had passed the order while hearing a plea filed by former vice chancellor of NLSIU Professor R Venkata Rao and a parent of the aspirant challenging the decision of university to hold a separate entrance exam.In the appeal against the Jharkhand High Court order, the petitioners, who are law aspirants, have sought stay on admissions to NLSIU on the basis of NLAT-2020, until disposal of their petition in the apex court.It claimed that the high court had failed to consider that there is no rational behind the introduction of a new mode and method of examination at such a short notice as the aspirants with lesser access to technology would be severely and prejudicially affected.It alleged that unilateral withdrawal by NLSIU Bengaluru from Common Law Admission Test (CLAT) violates the rights of petitioners to have an examination in a just and fair manner.The plea filed earlier in the apex court by the former vice chancellor and a parent of the aspirant has claimed that NLSIU action has created an unprecedented uncertainty and has imposed an onerous burden and obligations upon thousands of aspirants, who are now uncertain about the future course of action. It said that such a unilateral decision to hold National Law Aptitude Test (NLAT) as entrance exam to the university was taken without any application of mind, “thereby completely prejudicing the students at the final hour and has put their career at jeopardy for purely whimsical reasons”. The plea has sought quashing of notification for admission to the five-year integrated BA, LLB (Hons.) programme, 2020-21 read with the press release on NLSIU admissions 2020-21 dated September 4, 2020.

India and Japan are looking at the possibility of cooperating on projects in Bangladesh and Myanmar as part of their efforts to work together in third countries, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said on Friday.The India-Japan Act East Forum, which focuses on specific projects to modernise India’s northeastern region, also has a larger significance for connectivity with Bangladesh and Myanmar, Jaishankar said during a virtual event to mark the release of a report on the theme “India-Japan: Time to seize the opportunities”.The recent signing of the Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA), which covers the reciprocal provision of supplies and services by the defence forces of India and Japan, will enhance stability and security across Asia, he said.The minister’s remarks assume significance against the backdrop of efforts by several countries, including India, Australia and Japan, to forge new partnerships with countries across the Indo-Pacific in the face of China’s growing aggressive and assertive activities.India and Japan, Jaishankar noted, had moved from discussions to practically working together in third countries. “We’ve done a little bit of that in Sri Lanka and I think we’re today trying to see whether we can cooperate and coordinate more closely in Bangladesh and Myanmar,” he said.While noting that India and Japan were already working closely within the framework of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), East Asia Summit and the Quadrilateral dialogue, he suggested that they could also cooperate in Russia’s Far East and the Pacific Island countries.Jaishankar described ACSA, which was signed last week, as “a very practical manifestation of our ability and intent of working together”. He added, “I’m very confident that it would both be a big plus for the evolution of the Indo-Pacific vision of both countries [and add] to the stability and security of Asia.”Both countries are trying to shape the Indo-Pacific narrative to reflect the rebalancing of the world and Asia and bilateral defence and security cooperation has “progressed remarkably fast”, he remarked, adding that Japan is the only country with which India has both an annual summit and a 2+2 dialogue between the defence and foreign ministers.The Covid-19 pandemic has expanded national security to include health security along with economic and supply chain security, as well as the concept of strategic autonomy in terms of supply chains, and this could be a new area of cooperation with Japan, he suggested.While replying to a question at the event organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), Jaishankar said, without naming China, that it is important for all players to work together to ensure Asia’s rise.“If we are to give to Asia a more prominent place in world politics, then it’s important for all the nations of Asia, especially the large and important nations,...to get along together because if they spend their energies not in a positive manner but kind of contesting each other, they’re not going to advance the interests of Asia,” he said.Toshihide Ando, the deputy chief of the Japanese mission, told the event that Japan is a steadfast partner for both the “Make in India” and “Make for the world” initiatives. He added, “India will become stronger by playing a pivotal role in global supply chains through enhanced trade and investment.”Japanese businesses are keen to play a bigger role in India’s new quest to be the hub of global supply chains, and the number of Japanese firms operating in India increased to 1,454 last year, he noted.However, Ando also listed challenges faced by Japanese businesses in India, including complicated legal and tax systems, late payments, difficult labour issues, inadequate infrastructure, and problems linked to enforcement of contracts.“In an increasingly uncertain world, Japan and India can bring about an assurance of peace, stability and prosperity by working with other like-minded countries,” Ando said.
When MS Dhoni was the captain of Team India, it was clear on who was the next person in line. Virat Kohli was in top form and was groomed to be the next captain of the Indian cricket team. Dhoni’s sudden retirement from Test cricket pushed Kohli to take over the captaincy mid-tour in Australia. He has taken Indian cricket to new heights with the team becoming a top side in all formats of the game.With Kohli entering the early 30s, it now again has become a topic of discussion on who could take over the mantle from him. Vice-captain Rohit Sharma seemed the perfect candidate due to his championship run in IPL but he is also the same age as Kohli.READ | IPL 2020: Delhi Capitals vs Kings XI Punjab Preview – Two evenly-matched sides seek early momentumFormer India skipper Sunil Gavaskar has someone in mind who could become the vice-captain if he shoulders the responsibility well. Gavaskar named KXIP captain KL Rahul as the person who could be groomed for a leadership role.“There is a great chance for KL Rahul to show that he can score runs when given the responsibility. Secondly, he can show that he is capable of captaining a side and how he moulds his team and extracts effort. If he does that well he can even go on to become the vice-captain of the Indian team,” Gavaskar said on Sports Tak.“There are still players in the Indian team like Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, and Ajinkya Rahane. But going forward, he can be an option for the selection committee and can also become India’s future captain. So, this can be a huge tournament for KL Rahul as a skipper,” the original Little Master believes.Former India opening batsman Aakash Chopra also believes that Rahul could be the ideal successor to Kohli as the captain of the Indian team but for that, it will be important to see how the batsman performs as captain of Kings XI Punjab in IPL 2020.“I have hope that his captaincy will be good. Actually, we will get an idea of his captaincy, how he runs the game, what strategies he uses. If we see Kohli and Rohit, they are of the same age bracket and at one time you may feel that they are not captain material anymore,” Chopra said while responding to fan questions in a video shared on his Facebook page.“As they say, a time comes when you have to pass on the baton like MS Dhoni did to Kohli and Kohli will also have to do to someone at some point. When he does that, it is possible that Rahul will be next in line,” Chopra said.
Braving Covid-19 fear, thousands of medical aspirants along with their guardians poured in the capital city Patna for writing National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) held across 178 centres on Sunday.In Bihar, altogether 78,960 students had registered to write NEET across 193 exam centres spread in Patna and Gaya.Majority of students agreed that precautionary measures adopted at exam centres were satisfactory, however, numerous students faced major inconvenience due to concentration of exam centres in two districts (Patna and Gaya) out of 38, which forced them to travel 100 to 200 km for reaching exam centres.A NEET aspirant Anup Kumar from Saran district, said, “I left my home at 7 am to reach exam centre at 11 am. Travel for long hours and three-hour waiting period before commencement of exam exhausted me. For the first time, I wore mask for straight six hours. It caused suffocation”About precautionary measures taken at exam centre, he said, “Arrangements were satisfactory. We were provided fresh mask at entrance gate after thermal screening and hand sanitisation. Alternate seating arrangement was followed.”Candidates coming out of exam centres seemed relieved after taking exam. Examinees said that exam was moderate to difficult and rated biology the easiest while chemistry and physics moderate.Jyoti Kumari, who took exam at A N College, said, “I found physics difficult than biology. Few questions of botany section were difficult to understand. Physics questions were time taking and calculative.”She said, “I am quite relaxed after taking exam. Earlier I was worried to become a part of a big crowd but arrangements were stringent. Exam hall was sanitised and invigilator was wearing gloves. Contactless communication was adopted.”Another examinee Keshav who reached Patna from Bhagalpur said, “I travelled 250 km for reaching exam centre in Patna. Huge traffic jam near Bypass Road consumed time. “He said, “My exam was good. I found chemistry difficult as more questions were asked from organic section. Physics and Biology questions were moderate.”Traffic police were seen clearing traffic jam near Bailey Road, Boring Road, Digha and other localities after 5 pm after conclusion of exam.
Updated: Sep 19, 2020 14:34 ISTThe Rajya Sabha on Saturday passed the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Second Amendment) Bill, 2020, (this is the full name) by the voice vote. Speaking in Parliament after moving the motion, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said, the intention of the insolvency and bankruptcy code is to keep companies a “going concern” and not liquidate them.The bill will replace an ordinance promulgated in this regard in June. It was supported by most opposition members as they expressed hope saying it would help achieve an early revival of the economy.Here is what you need to know about the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Second Amendment) Bill:* The bill was moved with an aim to give immunity to stressed companies during the Covid-19 period as the businesses and livelihoods have been severely hit by the pandemic.* The bill prohibits any insolvency proceedings for defaults arising during the six months from March 25, 2020. The central government may extend this period for one year.* To prevent business being pushed into insolvency, the government suspended certain sections including the corporate insolvency resolution process, (CIRP) of the insolvency and bankruptcy code.* Speaking in favour of the bill, Praful Patel of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), said there is nothing in the bill to object to. However, he also called for relief in the form of interest subvention for tourism, transport and airline sectors as they are also reeling under financial stress.* The Janata Dal (United) leader Ram Chandra Prasad Singh called the bill progressive and said that it will help revive the economy.
Former Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) chief Anil Dhasmana has been appointed as the chief of National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO), India’s technical body that is responsible for geospatial intelligence and satellite imagery.The Appointments Committee of the Cabinet, headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, cleared the appointment and the decision was formally conveyed to the retired Indian Police Service officer on Friday. Dhasmana succeeds former Intelligence Bureau officer Satish Jha, who demitted office on Thursday.Dhasmana, a 1981 batch IPS officer, is a Pakistan expert and was the lead planner of the Balakot air strikes in February 2019. He had stepped down a few months later when his extended term due to the general elections ended in June 2019.
India’s external affairs and defence ministers recently dropped by Iran and talked to their counterparts, the first such talks since the pandemic began. Afghanistan, rather than oil supplies, tops the agenda, reflecting the new contours of the bilateral relationship. New Delhi and Tehran have reason to worry about the slow-but-steady withdrawal of United States (US) troops from Afghanistan and the Taliban resurgence that will follow. While Iran has its own problems with the US, and won’t be unhappy that the US troop presence along its northern border is winding down, it has reason to be concerned at the prospect of the present Kabul regime weakening. Tehran is known to have engaged with some Taliban leaders, but remains suspicious of its more hardcore factions, which are often intertwined with the Islamic State Khorasan Province and both are deeply anti-Shia.New Delhi’s views converge as these same Taliban factions are also the closest to Rawalpindi. At a time when Iran’s economy is stressed by sanctions and low oil prices, and its military stretched by deployments in Iraq and Syria, an unstable Afghanistan would not be welcome. The two countries need to coordinate their support for the Kabul regime. The partly India-funded freight corridor from Chabahar to Herat is the most tangible symbol of Afghan-related cooperation. The next few years will require such cooperation to expand into other spheres. As India’s energy ambitions revolve around weaning itself off oil and gas usage, there will be less traction to be gained in the energy sphere. But there will be more work to be done in the realm of regional security.

Rupal Patel has addressed allegations of her popular show, Saath Nibhaana Saathiya, being regressive. The actor, who played Kokilaben, the matriarch of the Modi family, on the show, said that it would be wrong to call it ‘completely backward’.Saath Nibhaana Saathiya told the story of cousins Gopi and Rashi, who marry Ahem and Jigar, two sons of the Modi family of Rajkot. The show highlighted the morals and values of a typical Gujarati joint family.In an interview with Pinkvilla, Rupal said that any content on television is a ‘reflection of the society’. “If you have to show the progress in any story, you will first have to show what happened previously, only then the change will be apparent. That graph needs to be there. Hence, we have to show characters like Gopi who was an illiterate but also very obedient. She was very soft spoken, but just because she was not literate, we can’t show her in poor light, right?,” she said.Rupal said that Gopi’s graph was shown in correlation with Kokilaben’s character. “We showed how under the guidance of Kokilaben, who was a righteous character, Gopi progresses. A bahu who washed off a laptop was shown to finally educate herself and her progress as a character was shown. But of course, all of this takes time. So, it is wrong to say that it is completely backward or regressive, one needs to be patient, that’s about it,” she said.Saath Nibhaana Saathiya is all set to return with a second season, which will have Rupal and Devoleena Bhattacharjee reprising their roles as Kokilaben and Gopi bahu, respectively. The show regained popularity recently, after a rap version of the ‘Rasode Mein Kaun Tha?’ scene went viral online.Two new cast members - Harsh Nagar and Sneha Jain - will play the lead roles of Anant and Gehna. A promo video for the second season was released, which featured Devoleena mentioning Gehna, although Sneha was not introduced in the short teaser.
Indian democracy has succeeded for a range of reasons — an enlightened political leadership which wrote a remarkably progressive Constitution; political parties which have played the democratic game within rules; an aware electorate which has kept the parties on their toes; a vibrant civil society which has championed rights and justice; a free press which has kept citizens informed and kept power under check; and, institutions which have fulfilled constitutional obligations.Among these institutions, India’s independent judiciary occupies a place of pride. For the most part, it has defended individual liberty and protected fundamental rights; it has expanded the idea of justice and pushed the State to support the vulnerable; it has resolved disputes between the State and citizens, among citizens, between the Centre and states, and between states; it has stood as a pillar in defence of the basic structure of the Constitution; it has served as a check on executive excesses; and it has given hope to all stakeholders, from the powerful to the weak, that there will be justice.And that is why a robust and independent judiciary is so critical to India’s constitutional functioning. In recent years, however, there appears to be a trend which suggests a much closer alignment between the judiciary and the executive than is healthy for a system based on checks and balances. The judiciary is far too important for anyone (including judges themselves) to assume it is perfect. On the basis of the principle that anything can be improved, this trend and its specific manifestations need further discussion.The first is the incentive structure of the judges. This is crucial to safeguarding the independence of the institution and maintaining its credibility. While the judiciary has fiercely guarded its right over appointments — though the executive has been able to exercise influence, both directly and indirectly, over the collegium process — there is another way in which judges may not be entirely free of external incentives while exercising their duty.A 2017 working paper — Jobs for Justice(s): Corruption in the Supreme Court of India — by Madhav Aney, Shubhankar Dam and Giovanni Ko, based on a dataset of all Supreme Court judgments between 1999 and 2014 involving the government, found that authoring judgments “in favour of the government” had a “positive” association with the likelihood of a prestigious post-SC retirement job. The paper, written for the Singapore Management University, concludes, “Our analysis suggests that the prospect of being appointed to government positions after retirement could be a way in which the executive exercises control over an otherwise independent judiciary, in countries with judicial term limits.” This trend appears to have only continued post-2014. When a former Chief Justice of India ends up becoming a Rajya Sabha member or a governor, nominated by the president on the advice of the council of ministers, doubts grow.In fact, it was the late and widely-respected Arun Jaitley — Bharatiya Janata Party leader, one of the country’s top legal minds, and former finance and law minister — who flagged the issue of post-retirement jobs influencing pre-retirement judgments almost a decade ago. Unless this incentive structure for judges changes — either through a prolonged cooling-off period before they can take on a role after retirement or a very restricted list of appointments — the perception that it is not just the legal facts of the case that determine a final judgment will prevail.The second issue is what legal scholars have termed as “constitutional evasion”. To be sure, the SC is overburdened. But there appears to be a pattern where the timing of when a matter is taken up, or when an order is delivered or judgment is pronounced, has been convenient for the executive.To be sure, the judiciary itself operates in a larger national and political ecosystem and to expect judges to operate in a vacuum may be unrealistic. But its ultimate loyalty has to be to the Constitution, without being swayed in any way by either public opinion or political thought. There have been a range of critical cases — the constitutionality of the changes in Jammu and Kashmir, the legality of the electoral bonds, the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, and most importantly, habeas corpus petitions — which are quite central to Indian democracy. But these have either not been taken up, or taken up after prolonged gaps, or not concluded.At the same time, issues that appear aligned with the political preferences of the executive have reached their logical conclusion. On Saturday, The Indian Express reported that out of 10 cases which were to do with freedom of speech, the court upheld the right or gave relief in cases where the State and the petitioner argued on the same side and in six cases where the State objected, there was no relief to the petitioner. Or take even Ayodhya — the SC should have delivered the verdict on the long-pending case much earlier than it finally did; but the timing of the final verdict worked well for the political executive. None of this may be deliberate, but it creates apprehensions which the judiciary can well do without.Three, in its approach to contempt, the SC appears to have adopted a somewhat rigid view. As debates elsewhere in constitutional democracies — particularly the United Kingdom — have evolved, the charge of “scandalising the court” has come to lose its validity. Yes, when there is an attempt to obstruct justice, when there is outright defiance of a court order by any party, when there is an effort to influence the legal process through extra-legal means, for instance bribing stakeholders, the Court must step in. But when there is criticism of the court, or of judges, then courts must be open — for it is this healthy criticism of institutions that help them improve in a democracy. Placing oneself above criticism, even as certain trends show that parts of the judiciary may not be working as independently as mandated, will not help the institution and its legacy.India’s judiciary is a key pillar which has to be fiercely independent and be seen as such. This does not mean that it needs to be consistently adversarial to the executive. Nor does it mean that it should be far too friendly with the executive. A relationship of respect but distance, and based on law, between the judiciary and the executive and a relationship of openness, where the judiciary is open to feedback from citizens while citizens recognise the supremacy of the courts, is the most effective way for democracy to thrive and for the institution to regain its credibility.letters@hindustantimes.com
The 13th edition of the Indian Premier League is set to kickstart on 19th September with Chennai Super Kings and Mumbai Indians playing the first match at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi, UAE. A number of overseas stars are missing from the initial stage due to other commitments. Australia and England players are currently engaged in an ODI series and will directly head to UAE after the commencement of the third ODI.They will have to undergo a six-day quarantine after arriving in the UAE keeping in mind the SOPs due to the Covid-19 pandemic. However, it has now emerged that Australia and England’s IPL-bound stars have requested the BCCI to reduce the duration to three days to ensure their availability from the start of the tournament.Around 21 players, currently part of an England-Australia white-ball series, will be boarding a chartered flight from Manchester to Dubai, touching base on September 17. They can only be available from September 23, while tournament gets underway from September 19.READ | IPL 2020: Gautam Gambhir explains why Mumbai Indians have ‘upper hand’ against Chennai Super Kings ahead of opening gameDesperate to not miss a single game, a big-hitting star has requested BCCI president Sourav Ganguly, on behalf of the players from both countries, to lessen the quarantine period to three days.Ganguly, who is in the UAE along with other office-bearers to oversee the tournament’s preparations, wasn’t available for a comment but a senior IPL source admitted that a plea has been made.“Yes, the BCCI president has received a request. It may have been written by one of the players but it is something that all the English and Australian players, who are coming from the UK, feel,” a senior IPL source told PTI on conditions of anonymity.The players feel that since they are already in a bio-bubble -- first in Australia and then in UK --, it’s only logical that “they be allowed to enter from one bio-bubble to another” as they haven’t been in contact with the outside world.“They have stayed at the Hilton hotel both in Southampton and Manchester, which is a part of the stadium. They have been tested every fifth day and even on the day of their departure from UK, they will be tested and also on first and third day of arrival.”If you go through safety bubble that the ECB created, not even housekeeping was allowed in the rooms of the players. Also they are taking a chartered flight and not a commercial one.“So they do have a point when they talk about entering from one bio-bubble to another,” said the IPL official but did not comment on whether the request would be accepted.The only franchise, which won’t be affected by the six-day quarantine rule is Kolkata Knight Riders as the team would be opening its campaign against Mumbai Indians on September 23.KKR have Tom Banton, Eoin Morgan and Pat Cummins on their roster with at least two being part of the first XI (other two being Andre Russell and Sunil Narine).However, the likes of Rajasthan Royals will be hit if Jofra Archer, Jos Buttler and Steve Smith are not available in the opening game considering that Ben Stokes is already out of at least the first half of the tournament due to his father’s illness.Sunrisers Hyderabad will miss their skipper David Warner, while his opening partner Jonny Bairstow, in all likelihood, won’t be available for at least one game.Chennai Super Kings will be without first-team players Josh Hazlewood and Sam Curran in opening first two games if the rule is adhered to.(with PTI inputs)
In his excellent book, The India Way: Strategies for an Uncertain World, external affairs minister S Jaishankar suggests that this is the time for India “to engage America, manage China, cultivate Europe, reassure Russia, bring Japan into play, draw neighbours in, extend the neighbourhood and expand traditional constituencies of support”.The succinct, but insightful, formulation, in a way, summarises the current Indian approach to the world. Each of the relationships Jaishankar alludes to are interlinked, but the most important dynamic at the moment — given the situation in eastern Ladakh — is the one with China. So, what does managing China mean?In a subsequent chapter devoted to China, Jaishankar brings a more sweeping view of the relationship — from the cultural connections of the past, the memory of which has faded away, to the romance of the 1950s, which was based on a clear misreading of China’s strategic intent; from the consistent Chinese partnership with Pakistan since 1963 to lock India into the South Asian box to the systemic pulls and pressures of global politics, which continue to affect bilateral ties; and from the nature of enhanced India-China economic engagement, which has caused deep discomfort in India to the border question left by history. On this hotly-contested issue, Jaishankar makes a simple case which is now clear Indian policy, “Today, the bottomline for the relationship is clear: peace and tranquillity must prevail on the border if progress made in the last three decades is not to be jeopardised. The border and future of ties cannot be separated.”This, then, is the core of the Indian foreign policy paradigm today. The establishment in Delhi has no doubts that China is a competitor and a possible adversary. At the same time, there is a clear recognition, as articulated by Jaishankar himself, of “gaps in our comprehensive national power”, capabilities, human development indices or growth conditions with China. Given the complex nature of inter-State ties that define the international system, and the need for peace to ensure India can focus on its own domestic development goals, this means that India’s best-case scenario is “managing” China instead of entertaining anything more ambitious.For the last three decades, ever since Rajiv Gandhi’s historic visit to Beijing, this management has taken a cooperative form — deepening economic cooperation, convergence on a set of global issues, high-level visits, agreements on border tranquillity. It has also taken a competitive form — with both countries jostling to expand their space in the neighbourhood and extended neighbourhood, China consistently blocking India’s global ambitions, India closely collaborating with the United States with an eye on China and pushing the idea of the Indo-Pacific, and a continued contest over both sovereignty and security.It is this old framework of management of ties that now lies in tatters, for if the border is unstable, the entire relationship can fare no better. This is the core message Jaishankar delivered to his counterpart, Wang Yi, on Thursday in Moscow. It leaves open two distinct possibilities for the immediate context.The first scenario is that China understands the message, calculates that limited acquisition of territory in eastern Ladakh is not worth alienating India entirely, pulls back, and postpones the dispute for another day — India, in turn, also subsequently de-escalates, and while the relationship will never go back to a pre-Ladakh 2020 normal, there is renewed dialogue over other issues to indicate the restoration of normalcy. The second possibility is that China decides that this is a matter of prestige and national security, it is the moment to “show India its place” and exercise dominance, digs its heels in, continues to attempt intrusions into Indian territory, and the stalemate continues through the long winter, with the possibility of an escalation.India has to wait and watch what China does on the ground now, while remaining alert and pre-empting any aggressive moves. But irrespective of what happens in eastern Ladakh, it is clear that managing China will now require a different toolkit. What will this entail?The first is building internal economic — and subsequently military — capabilities. India just cannot compete with China in any meaningful way if its economy continues to contract or if it has a minimal positive growth rate. In such a scenario, the government will have more limited resources; crucial military modernisation plans will get halted or slow down; the power of Indian businesses to compete globally will shrink; the Indian market will suddenly not appear as attractive; the government will have to shift focus to address domestic economic distress and possible social unrest; Delhi won’t be able to take autonomous economic decisions to reduce dependence on China; and India’s ability to buy goodwill in the neighbourhood will become more limited. There is no substitute for internal economic capability as a national security tool to manage China. On this, the government’s record has been weak.The second is cementing international partnerships. Washington, obviously, has its own interests, and it is not going to come and fight India’s battles. But the United States remains, despite all its current challenges, the world’s pre-eminent power and indispensable in ensuring that the international order does not tilt towards China. It has also, on strategic questions, been a steadier partner than many in Delhi had assumed. India needs a frank discussion on whether it is time to partner with the US more substantially and openly. This has to be supplemented with a range of other partnerships, from sustaining ties with Russia to acting in concert with other middle powers. On this metric, the government has done a competent job.Three, India needs to invest more in the neighbourhood — not just in terms of connectivity but by actively ensuring that political regimes in the periphery are aligned with India. This will mean criticism of being interventionist at times; it will result in setbacks at other times. But playing quiet even as China is actively propping up governments and creating a hostile environment against India is not a solution. On this, India’s record is mixed.And finally, it is time to play on China’s internal weaknesses. India hosts the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan government-in-exile, and hundreds of thousands of Tibetans. But India continues to insist that this is not a political act and, too often, reiterates its recognition of Tibet as a part of China. With this mixed approach, India earns China’s wrath, but it doesn’t earn Tibetan goodwill either, and its own ability to embarrass Beijing shrinks. Instead, a consistent policy with the following elements — a formal announcement that India will respect the Dalai Lama’s wishes on his succession, outreach to all Tibetan sects and political streams, and advocacy of their political and cultural rights — is important. China has made it clear that it does not respect India’s sensitivities on Kashmir or Arunachal Pradesh; Tibet must be the riposte. On this metric, the government’s policy is an enigma.India neither wants a war, nor can it afford one. India needs to live in peace, and focus on its massive developmental challenges. But often geopolitics throws up challenges which a State has to confront. India will have to learn to manage China better, and it won’t always be a smooth ride.letters@hindustantimes.com
China faces a major test in its vaccine diplomacy, with a deadline fast approaching on whether it will officially join a World Health Organization-backed effort to ensure everyone across the globe is inoculated against Covid-19.Friday is the final day for governments to decide whether to take part in Covax, an $18 billion initiative that aspires to give lower-income countries the same access to vaccines as wealthier nations. Beijing has said it “supports” Covax without clearly saying if it’s putting any money into the project. The confirmed list of participants will be published on Monday, Sept. 21, according to the WHO.Signing up would help to repair China’s image around the world over how it handled the initial outbreak in Wuhan, particularly since the Trump administration has refused to join Covax. So far, Beijing has focused on cutting one-on-one deals for vaccine doses with friendly governments as the US urges nations to shun Chinese companies for 5G networks, computer chips and big infrastructure projects.“Beijing is battling criticism from the West over the origin of Covid-19 in Wuhan and China’s transparency around the early days of the virus spread,” said Kelsey Broderick, an analyst at Eurasia Group. “Joining a popular initiative like Covax would certainly help shift the perception that China is a bad actor.”President Xi Jinping in May promised that vaccines developed by China will be a global “public good” that can be shared by all. Still, China hasn’t clarified if it will sign up, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying only saying this month that China’s actions are “in essence the same with Covax.”Covax, which is also led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the vaccine alliance Gavi, is designed to give governments an opportunity to hedge the risk of backing unsuccessful vaccine candidates and give less developed countries access to shots that would be otherwise unaffordable. It currently has nine vaccines in development and nine under evaluation in its portfolio. The goal is to secure 2 billion doses by 2021.China Expects Virus Vaccine to Be Ready in November, Expert SaysSelf-financing countries can pay up front for vaccine doses that would cover as much as 50% of their populations, though shots would be proportionally distributed among poor and rich countries alike as they become available. Governments that sign up are free to reach bilateral deals to secure supplies separately. Having China on board would be a big deal for Covax, which had some 172 countries in discussion to participate as of Aug. 24. The possibility of providing doses to even a fraction of China’s 1.4 billion people would boost critical mass, enhancing the alliance’s negotiating power.For China, Covax could act as a kind of insurance policy that allows it access to any successfully developed vaccine. While being a member doesn’t necessarily mean Chinese vaccines will be included in Covax’s portfolio, it’s probable that’ll be the case. China could also provide manufacturing support for a successful vaccine, regardless of which country develops it.Participation could mean that Chinese vaccine manufacturers play a significant role in the global roll-out. And if a Chinese-developed vaccine were selected their brands would benefit from WHO certification, according to Xiaoqing Lu Boynton, a consultant at Albright Stonebridge Group who focuses on health care and life sciences.China Made an Epic Dash for PPE That Left World Short on Masks“It would be a big boost for Beijing both from the industry perspective as well as politically,” she said.Diplomatic AngleChina doesn’t have much experience in manufacturing and distributing a vaccine for global consumption. The industry’s reputation took a hit in 2018 when two Chinese vaccine-makers were found to have cut corners in production, undermining confidence both at home and abroad.Still, China has been a front-runner in developing vaccines against the coronavirus. Nine of China’s vaccine candidates have entered clinical trials, and four of them got approval for final stage Phase III clinical trials in foreign countries.Biden Embraces Vaccines, Science: ‘I Don’t Trust Donald Trump’Tianjin-based CanSino was the first in the world to reach the crucial final stage of human testing for a vaccine it co-developed with the Chinese military. CanSino Biologics, Sinovac Biotech Ltd. and China National Biotec Group have kicked off testing in countries including Brazil, Russia, Indonesia, the United Arab Emirates, Peru, Chile and Morocco.The vaccine could help Beijing make up lost diplomatic ground as China comes under fire for threats to Taiwan as well as human-rights abuses in Hong Kong and Xinjiang. China has promised to prioritize providing doses for at least 62 countries, including governments that have received infrastructure loans under Xi’s Belt and Road Initiative. Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Morocco have formal agreements with China’s major vaccine manufacturers, and Egypt is close to signing one.“Both the Chinese government and state-owned enterprises would much like to protect their own infrastructure projects as well as personnel on the ground,” said Yu Jie, senior research fellow on China at think tank Chatham House. “If the epidemiological situation improves across those countries, it would help China too.”Latin American and Caribbean countries have been promised a $1 billion loan to purchase a Chinese designed vaccine. Currently, Mexico, Chile, Brazil, and Argentina have all made commitments to testing a Chinese vaccine. The region remains the hardest hit, with Brazil, Mexico and Peru among the world’s top 10 countries by total Covid-related deaths.Trusting ChinaSill, a global lack of trust in China due to Xi’s more aggressive foreign policy makes the international community doubtful of China’s behavior and intentions, said Yoshikazu Kato, an adjunct professor at the Asia Global Institute at the University of Hong Kong who specializes in Chinese diplomacy.“Under these circumstances, how can countries trust China?” he said.Trump-Xi Rift Plays Out With Some 100 Canceled Exchanges, TalksAn incident involving CanSino and Canada underscored concerns that China could use its vaccine for political purposes. The Chinese company was supposed to send its vaccine candidate so that clinical trials could begin in Canada, but Chinese customs hasn’t approved the shipments, according to the National Research Council Canada.Malaysia is in talks with many parties, including China. “We have more questions than answers at the moment,” said Noor Hisham Abdullah, the Southeast Asian nation’s Director General of Health. Vietnam, which has sparred with Beijing over territorial disputes in the South China Sea, last month agreed to purchase millions of doses of Russia’s vaccine, and it’s developing a national one expected to be ready late next year.Not everyone is concerned. The Philippines, which has expressed a willingness to accept a vaccine from the U.S., Russia, and China, rejected any notion that China may be using the vaccine to curry diplomatic favors. “No such concern about China’s vaccine at all,” said Teodoro Locsin, the Philippine foreign affairs secretary.“I think that it’s in China’s interest to join,” said Wang Huiyao, an adviser to China’s cabinet and founder of the Center for China and Globalization, referring to Covax. “If the world is still in the pandemic, China will not be in good shape either.”
Updated: Sep 14, 2020 21:04 ISTJapan’s SoftBank Group said Monday it is selling British chip designer Arm to US firm NVIDIA for up to $40 billion, potentially creating a new giant in the industry but sparking an investigation by UK regulators and fears about the impact on jobs.If approved, the deal will be one of the largest acquisitions anywhere in the world this year and propel NVIDIA to the forefront of the semiconductor sector.The announcement also renewed speculation about SoftBank Group’s future, with Bloomberg News reporting it is set to revive talks about going private via a management buyout plan.The Arm sale is valued at up to $40 billion and is subject to approval by authorities in several jurisdictions, including Britain, China, the United States and the European Union, SoftBank Group said in a statement.It hopes the deal will be completed by around March 2022, it added.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman confirmed UK regulators were looking into the deal, and its implications for Arm’s headquarters in the university city of Cambridge, eastern England.The company’s co-founder, Hermann Hauser, meanwhile wrote to Johnson voicing fears about jobs and Britain becoming “collateral damage” in the US trade war with China.“Arm powers the smartphones of Apple, Samsung, Sony, Huawei and practically every other brand in the world and therefore can exert influence on all of them,” he said.“Surrendering UK’s most powerful trade weapon to the US is making Britain a US vassal state.”- Market dominance -SoftBank Group shares soared in early morning trade in Tokyo, rising by almost 10 percent at one point. They ended the day up 8.95 percent to 6,385 yen.Founded in 1990, Arm specialises in microprocessors and dominates the global smartphone market. But its chips are also found in countless sensors, smart devices and cloud services.NVIDIA, well known for graphics cards favoured in the video game industry, has seen sales skyrocket during the coronavirus crisis, with gaming a popular pastime in lockdown.Its products are also increasingly used for artificial intelligence and in data centres.SoftBank bought Arm in 2016 for $32 billion in a deal that left investors cold and saw the conglomerate’s stock plunge sharply.Analysts at the time said SoftBank had paid too much for the firm and the purchase revived concerns about the Japanese company’s balance sheet.Amir Anvarzadeh, senior market strategist at Asymmetric Advisors in Singapore, said Arm had been “underperforming”, making the sale more attractive for SoftBank.But he said the acquisition was “going to raise some eyebrows” in the semiconductor industry, because so many of NVIDIA’s competitors work with Arm’s designs.“They will need some guarantees... otherwise Arm may lose business or face lawsuits,” he said.- SoftBank speculation -NVIDIA said in a statement that under the deal it will pay SoftBank $21.5 billion in common stock and $12 billion in cash, $2 billion of which will be payable at signing.SoftBank may receive up to another $5 billion in cash or stock, dependent on Arm’s performance.And NVIDIA will also issue $1.5 billion in equity to Arm employees, for a deal worth a total of up to $40 billion.SoftBank said it felt Arm would perform better in combination with NVIDIA and the sale would “contribute to an increase in our company’s value for shareholders”.It said the deal would give it a combined total of 6.7-8.1 percent of NVIDIA’s outstanding shares, but insisted that would not make the US firm a subsidiary or affiliate.NVIDIA said the acquisition would help “create the premier computing company for the age of artificial intelligence”.It said Arm would retain its name and remain in Cambridge in the UK, where a new global centre for excellence in AI will be set up.The sale, which comes as SoftBank engages in a massive push to boost its cash reserves, renewed speculation about the firm’s future plans.Bloomberg News, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter, said senior SoftBank executives planned to revisit a management buyout, which had previously met with internal opposition, but discussions were an early stage.
Bigg Boss 14 is all set to return to the small screens and the channel has released an all new promo ahead of the much-anticipated premiere. It features Gauahar Khan who gives a stern warning to the contestants set to join the reality show.The video opens with Gauahar, all dressed up in a skyblue ruffled gown, sitting on a chair placed on a huge chess board. She goes on to talk about how she has always supported the truth and walked the path of righteousness. She claims that surviving the 2020 lockdown makes one feel confident about overcoming any difficulty but nothing would be easy in the upcoming season which is all set to bring an unexpected storm. The video ends with Bigg Boss host Salman Khan saying, “Bigg Boss denge 2020 ko jawab.”The show will have its grand premiere on October 3 at 9pm.Colors TV had earlier shared a picture of Salman mopping the floor. It went with the caption, “Salman says everyone is bored of shuttling between home and work. But not to phikar as life is about to change with Bigg Boss’s power-packed entertainment coming for their rescue.”An Indian Express report had also quoted a source as saying, “Throughout the lockdown, people have missed certain activities, be it shopping, eating out or watching films. As part of the luxury tasks, contestants would be able to win a chance to enjoy these in the Bigg Boss 14 house. As Salman Khan said in the teaser videos, this would be a befitting reply to 2020.”Recently, pictures and videos of the new Bigg Boss house leaked online. It showed a colourful house, especially designed in rainbow hues. While celebrities such as Nia Sharma, Pavitra Punia, Akanksha Puri, Nishant Malkani, Eijaz Khan, Naina Singh, Kumar Janu and Vivian Dsena are expected to participate in the upcoming season, Aly Goni, Karan Patel, Adhyayan Suman have denied entering the house.
When Asura Khatun woke up and saw policemen entering her house to arrest her husband in the early hours of Saturday, it was a bolt from the blue for her.“I asked them what my husband Al Mamun Kamal had done. They didn’t reply and instead told me to ask my husband what he had done. I asked my husband. Even he didn’t reply. He just told me not to worry and that if he was innocent, he would return soon. Else he would be punished,” Bibi said.Kamal was picked up from his house at Jalangi in West Bengal’s Murshidabad district by the National Investigative Agency (NIA). He was one of the six men accused of being radicalised by a Pakistan-based al Qaeda module to carry out terror attacks in India.“I still don’t know why he was picked up. He was earlier in Kerala for work. He returned home around two years back and since then has been working as a wage labourer here. I have a seven-month-old daughter,” Bibi said.The NIA also arrested three more accused from Kerala’s Ernakulam. Murshidabad is one the three Muslim-dominated districts in West Bengal and is located along the Indo-Bangla international border, one of the most porous international borders in India.Even the family members of 22-year-old Najmus Shakib are still in the dark as to why he was nabbed by sleuths of the central agency.“First they questioned my elder son. My younger son (Najmus Shakib) was standing next to him. He had a beard. They asked him why he has kept beard. Then they took him upstairs and searched the room. They seized a few documents, arrested him and took him away. We still don’t know why he was arrested. He was not earning anything. He only used to study and went to the mosque regularly,” Toumana Bibi, the accused’s mother and a resident of Domkal said.This is, however, not the first time that people with links to terrorist organizations have been picked up from the district. Earlier this year, a top Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) operative, allegedly involved in the January 2018 Bodh Gaya blast case, was arrested from a hideout in Murshidabad. Earlier in February 2018, another JMB operative was arrested from the district.“I don’t know what he did. Police didn’t tell us anything. They (cops) just came around 2 am and arrested him. He was a graduate and worked as an electrician. He was not into any criminal activities,” said Sariful Islam, father of Leu Yean Ahmed, 34, a resident of Domkal area in Murshidabad.According to data from the 2011 census, Bengal ranks fourth among the states from where people migrate. Between 2001 and 2011, 5.8 lakh people had migrated from Bengal. The number is now over 11 lakh, according to the state government. Murshidabad accounts for the most migration among all districts.All six arrested men – Abu Sufiyan, Mainul Mondal, Atitur Rehman along with Shakib, Kamal and Ahmed - were produced in a special NIA court in Kolkata on Saturday.

Updated: Sep 18, 2020 13:25 ISTActor Sanjay Dutt’s wife Maanayata shares a new picture of the family with her husband and her kids - Iqra and Shahraan. She said how she just wanted to be with her family and had no complaints against the almighty.She wrote: “Today...I want to thank God for the gift of family. No complaints...No requests... just to be together, forever. Amen #blessedbeyondmeasure #love #grace #positivity #dutts #beautifullife #thankyougod.” A number of fans of the actor wrote in to express solidarity with him. One user wrote “love u baba” while another said “Godbless u all.” Sanjay and Maanayata had left for Dubai earlier this week to be with their kids.In August this year, Sanjay was diagnosed with Stage 4 lung cancer. Taking to Instagram, Sanjay had addressed his illness with fans. “Hi friends, I am taking a short break from work for some medical treatment. My family and friends are with me and I urge my well wishers not to worry or unnecessarily speculate. With your love and good wishes, I will be back soon!”However, soon after, speculations were rife that the actor would leave for the US for further treatment. However, Maanayata had released a statement clarifying that the actor would complete preliminary treatment in Mumbai. She had said: “For those asking, Sanju will complete his preliminary treatment in Mumbai. We will formulate further plans of travel depending on how and when the Covid situation eases. As of now, Sanju is in the best hands of our esteemed doctors at Kokilaben hospital. I request everyone, with my folded hands, to stop speculating the stage of his illness and let the doctors continue to do their work. We will update you all regularly with his progress.”Sanjay was recently seen in Sadak 2 along with Pooja Bhatt, Alia Bhatt and Aditya Roy Kapur. The actor has a number of films in various stages of production including Kannada film, KGF 2, Torbaaz, Prithviraj, Shamshera and Bhuj: The Pride of India.
The National Education Policy 2020 (NEP) has introduced innovative concepts to improve access, equity and quality education in India. It is forward-looking and student-centric, giving students the freedom to choose disciplines, colleges and universities. This freedom is envisioned through the choice-based credit system, multiple entry-multiple exit (MEME) options in a programme and, most importantly, the establishment of an Academic Bank of Credit (ABC). ABC will digitally store academic credits earned from recognised higher education institutions (HEIs) and allow for credit redemption in order to be awarded a certificate, diploma or degree.ABC is an online entity to be established and managed by the ministry of education. It will function much like a commercial bank with students as account-holders to whom the bank provides services, including credit accumulation, credit transfer, credit redemption through the opening, closure and validation of accounts. Students who pursue education as freelancers can also accumulate credits. These credits can be deposited to student accounts. After the accumulation of credits, a student can redeem these in order to get any academic degree. It works on the principle of MEME as well as “anytime learning, anywhere learning, and any level learning”. It can facilitate the integration of campuses by creating student mobility within the university system. ABC can also help integrate skills into a credit-based system by providing a credit recognition mechanism. It will, however, not give awards, degrees or certificates. Opening an account with ABC is not mandatory.Its objectives include promoting student-centricity in higher education and enabling them to select courses, departments or institutions; allowing students to choose a pace for their studies along with associated cost, and enabling MEME for students to complete their degrees as per their preferences; and permitting teaching-learning activities with increased integration of campuses to facilitate lifelong learning among formal and informal students for full-time and part-time modes.Students who may or may not have been enrolled in HEI but wish to pursue an education and consolidate their academic records for employment or other purposes can register with ABC. It enables a student to accumulate institutional credits from numerous sources into a single account.It will maintain academic records and issue an official transcript. This transcript will be recognised by all the member-universities of ABC. If students are working towards a qualification, they will have to accumulate sufficient credits to gain the total credit value of the qualification. Students may be able to transfer their credits as part of one study programme to another, offered by the same institution, and/or transfer credit when moving from one institution to another. How students can transfer credits is determined by each institution’s assessment regulations. However, the transfer of credits between HEIs of similar categories will be allowed to ensure quality. For instance, the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) A-grade credits can be transferred to other A grades and to B or C grades. However, credits earned from HEI with lower NAAC grades may not be transferred at the same value to higher NAAC grade institutions.ABC can be operationalised under a standard framework such as the National Academic Depository under the aegis of the ministry of education. A participating institution/university will have to formally qualify and agree to be a part of ABC. The credits earned will be recorded with an approved national agency and will have a fully-defined shelf life for its value in the award of a degree/diploma/post-graduate diploma/certificates.ABC is a revolutionary step which will promote access, equity, quality, flexibility, mobility, collaboration, transparency, and integration to improve the competitiveness and efficiency of India’s education system.Bhushan Patwardhan is vice-chairman, UGC and Pankaj Mittal is secretary general, AIUThe views expressed are personal
The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has approached the England Cricket Board, seeking advice about creating a bio-secure environment for the forthcoming international series against Zimbabwe.England had hosted Pakistan in bio-secure environment. The Zimbabwe team is scheduled to reach Pakistan on October 20 after which the Board is expected to schedule their T20 and ODI matches in Multan and Rawalpindi.“These two venues are under consideration since both will be hosting the National T20 Championship in a bio-secure environment because of Covid-19 restrictions,” a PCB source said.According to the source, the series against Zimbabwe is being taken very seriously by the Board as it will allow the PCB to invite other teams to Pakistan in future even if the Covid-19 pandemic does not die down soon.The PCB will also be hosting four remaining matches of the Pakistan Super League 5 in November in Lahore with the domestic season also in full swing from late September to February.The PCB after its national and A teams toured New Zealand in November-December is yet to decide whether to invite South Africa for a series before the PSL begins in February or to tour South Africa after the league ends in late March.The PCB is also hopeful for future tours by New Zealand, Australia and England in the next 20 months.
Sanskrit schools in Uttar Pradesh are in trouble. Of the 958 Sanskrit schools offering the subject from classes 6 to 12, 117 of them do not have a single teacher left, while 58 government-aided Sanskrit-medium secondary schools have already closed down due to a shortage of teachers. Reason for the shortage: recruitment of Sanskrit teachers has been stuck in bureaucratic limbo for the past three decades.State secondary education minister and deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma said, “We are aware of the acute shortage of teachers in Sanskrit schools of the state. We are in the process of appointing retired Sanskrit teachers in the most-affected schools for the time being and have also decided to fill up the vacant posts on a priority.”After coming to power, the BJP government in the state had entrusted the responsibility of appointments in Sanskrit schools to the Uttar Pradesh Secondary Education Service Selection Board (UPSESSB). The Secondary Education department had sent a requisition for the appointment of 1,282 teachers a year ago but recruitments have not started till date, rued a senior teacher of a Prayagraj-based Sanskrit school.The situation can be understood by the fact that out of 42 Sanskrit schools in Prayagraj district alone, as many as 18 do not have a single teacher left. Three of these schools are ‘open with just peons managing affairs, while one is opening with things being managed by a clerk, the teacher claimed. There are about a dozen schools where there is only one teacher, he added. Seeing the alarming condition of Sanskrit education, Uttar Pradesh Sanskrit Sansthan (Lucknow) chairman Vachaspati Mishra had written to deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma on August 16, requesting to arrange for teachers on an honorarium or on contract basis.“The state government has been informed about the shortage of teachers in Sanskrit schools across the state. I am confident that this problem will be resolved soon,” said Mishra.State Sanskrit Schools Teachers’ Association vice-president and spokesperson Rajesh Mishra ‘Dheer’ said, “With the recruitment of teachers not having taken place in almost 30 years now, Sanskrit education is taking a serious hit in UP.”How Many Vacancies and WhereOf the existing 1,282 vacant posts for principals and teachers, the maximum number of over 135 posts is vacant in Varanasi. Though officials are tight-lipped over the issue, according to the Education Directorate information, Varanasi district has 20 posts of principals and 83 posts of assistant teachers vacant, while Ghazipur and Chandauli have a total of around 25 and seven vacant posts, respectively. In Ghazipur, seven posts of principals and 18 posts of assistant teachers are vacant, while in Chandauli one post of principal and six posts of assistant teachers are lying vacant. Similarly, Gorakhpur division has 117 vacant posts including around 52 in Gorakhpur district (nine of principals and 43 of assistant teachers), 24 in Deoria (five of principals and 19 of assistant teachers), 20 in Kushinagar (five of principals and 15 of assistant teachers) and 21 posts in Maharajganj district (four of principals and 17 of assistant teachers). Chitrakoot division on the other hand has 84 vacant posts (Banda-40, Hamirpur-15, Chitrakoot-24 and Mahoba-five) while Jhansi division has 37 (Lalitpur-five, Jhansi-19, Jalaon-13), Agra has 83 (Agra-14, Firozabad-eight, Mainpuri-13), Prayagraj has 64 (Fatehpur-41 and Kaushambi-23), Basti has 65, Azamgarh has 74, Meerut has 53, Mirzapur has 43, Saharanpur has 12, Lucknow has 77, Bareilly has 61, Moradabad has 30, Ayodhya has 66, Devipatan has 54 and Aligarh has 51 vacant posts.

Updated: Sep 18, 2020 09:46 ISTPresident Donald Trump’s son Eric is willing to be questioned in connection with a probe by New York’s attorney general into whether his father and the Trump Organization overstated the value of assets to obtain loans and tax benefits - if it can wait until after the Nov. 3 election.In a Thursday court filing, Eric Trump’s lawyers said his “extreme travel schedule and related unavailability” and “the importance of avoiding any appearance of politicizing the investigatory process” justified the delay.They also said they had proposed four dates for Eric Trump to be questioned in the civil probe, beginning on Nov. 19.“Eric Trump has been, and continues to be, willing to appear pursuant to a subpoena,” the lawyers said.A spokesman for Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement: “While we cannot comment on the particular steps we’re taking on specific litigation, we won’t allow any entity or individual to dictate how our investigation will proceed or allow anyone to evade a lawful subpoena.”James on Aug. 24 accused the Trump Organization, where Eric Trump is an executive vice president, of resisting subpoenas for her probe into “potential fraud or illegality,” while there had been no determination any laws had been broken.The attorney general said her probe began after Donald Trump’s former personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen told Congress the president’s financial statements had inflated some asset values to save money on loans and insurance, and deflated other asset values to reduce real estate taxes.Four properties were being probed: the Seven Springs Estate in Westchester County, New York; 40 Wall Street in Manhattan; the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago, and the Trump National Golf Club in Los Angeles.The Trump Organization has said the probe into Donald Trump, a Republican, by James, a Democrat, was “all about politics.”In Thursday’s filing, its lawyers also said it should not be required to turn over “thousands of pages of privileged communications” from its lawyers that James also subpoenaed.A hearing is scheduled for Sept. 23 in a New York state court in Manhattan.
India captain Virat Kohli is regarded as one of the best batsmen in the world at the moment. The right-handed batsman has already achieved huge milestones in his young career, and cricketing pundits continue to ponder over what more he could achieve before the end of his career. In a recent interaction, veteran Harbhajan Singh recalled his first encounter with Kohli and said that he immediately recognised that Kohli was going to be a star.Harbhajan, who pulled out of IPL 2020 earlier this month citing personal reasons, recalled an Indian Premier League match between Mumbai Indians and Royal Challengers Bangalore from 2008 in which a young Virat Kohli struck Sanath Jayasuriya for a six.IPL 2020 Full Coverage“I had heard Virat Kohli’s name before the IPL auction from Lalchand Rajput. In an IPL game, I was the captain of the Mumbai Indians, Sachin paaji was sitting out. Virat Kohli hit Jayasuriya for a six by stepping out of his crease,” Harbhajan said on Star Sports’ show ‘IPL memories’.“He was not afraid of the fact that a man of Jayasuriya’s stature was bowling to him. That showed me that he is one for the future,” Harbhajan further added.Former India pacer Irfan Pathan also recalled early encounters with Kohli and said that he realised quickly how focused the batsman was towards his game.“Whenever I used to watch Virat Kohli in the IPL, I used to see only one man. A young man who is enjoying both on the field as well as off the field. But he never sidelined cricket,” Pathan said.“The good thing is that he always kept his focus on cricket. This is why he is one of the best players in the world right now and it shows how much commitment he has,” he further added.Kohli-led RCB will look to win their first IPL title this year in the UAE when the tournament kicks off from September 19th.
The Fifteenth Finance Commission (FFC) is finalizing its recommendations for the sharing of resources between the Centre and the states. Ahead of the release of the recommendations, FFC chairman N.K Singh spoke to Mint candidly and shared his views on the challenges the panel faced and the broad contours of their proposals. Edited excerpts:How have your recommendations been influenced in such a tumultuous year?I have already given a report for one year, 2020-21, in the context of the economic slowdown at that time, because you know even before Covid-19, if you look at the figures around October of last year, when we gave the report we factored in that we wanted to look to better growth prospects. To some extent, for 2020-21, whatever we wanted to give, we have given to the President, the government accepted it and placed before Parliament. We are now expected to give a report for the period that begins 2021-22. The first challenge is to assess the impact of the pandemic on the work of the commission. Clearly, there is huge uncertainty and huge vulnerabilities. Uncertainty in the sense that we do not know the path of the pandemic. The fiscal pressures in dealing with issues of livelihood is a totally new factor the commission has had to deal with.How else have the circumstances of this Finance Commission been exceptional?There are the two other distinguishing characteristics of this volatile period. Unlike other Finance Commissions, which made one gross domestic product (GDP) growth assumption throughout the award period, we did not have that opportunity. Also, we could not project a uniform growth figure for the Centre and the states. We have had to distinguish between fast growing and slow growing states. The dynamics are complex. We recognize that from a low base of this year, there is bound to be sharp recovery next year. However, that could mechanically arise from the low base. Then there is the issue of reckoning the extra expenditure of the central and state governments. This can be done in part by expenditure reprioritization. The pandemic has exposed the vulnerabilities of the health system and both the Centre and the states have to reprioritize their expenditure. We are a unique FC during a pandemic.After goods and services tax (GST) compensation period is over in June 2022 and states have limited scope for raising revenues, do you think states may require a higher share of total divisible pool of revenues than the current 41%?From 2022 onwards, we have projected a rate of growth for the central government as well as state governments. I fully applaud the central government in reiterating the fact that they are not rescinding the liability of the 14% (protected GST revenue growth). I recognize that the period of cess will continue beyond such time as this liability is not extinguished. I, therefore, assume that this amount, which may be necessary, would be coterminous with my award period. This will imply, if that is so, to some extent, depending on how the economy behaves and the GST compensation cess behaves, a (fiscal) cliff can be avoided. I am also putting great emphasis on deepening of structural reforms, many of which have been announced and many of which are in the offing. I reckon that the far reaching reforms in agriculture will be further deepened. We ourselves are proposing some initiatives regarding the agriculture sector. I assume that on power and infrastructure sectors, many important reforms have commenced.Are you saying that structural reforms will continue and you see an economic multiplier because of them?We expect it and we strongly suggest continuation and deepening of structural reforms. Yes, (we see a) multiplier effect from structural reforms, revenue reforms and expenditure reprioritization. As part of our response to the pandemic, for the first time one of the chapters of our report deals with health. We have recognized that the public outlay on health currently is less than 1% (of GDP) including 0.6% by states and 0.3% by the Centre. The pandemic has showed up the historic neglect of the health sector, particularly when the Planning Commission existed. We will endorse the 2017 health policy which talks about 2.5% (of GDP) to be devoted to the health sector. We have focused quite a bit on reprioritization of expenditure in terms of strengthening the primary health centres, infectious diseases, testing laboratories and some of the important areas.Read full interview on www. livemint.com
Former Australia spinner Brad Hogg, who played for Kolkata Knight Riders in the Indian Premier League between 2015-2016, said earlier this month that relationship between Kolkata Knight Riders player Andre Russell and KKR skipper Dinesh Karthik could hurt the franchise in IPL 2020. The rumours of rift between the two players started last year after Russell, at a press conference, questioned some of the decisions made by the team.While Karthik, in previous interviews this year, has stressed that the two players had a discussion over the same and have sorted things out, there still seems to be some concerns among fans and followers regarding any possible rift in the KKR camp.IPL 2020 Full CoverageFormer Australia batsman David Hussey, who joined KKR as a mentor this year, opened up on the same in a recent interaction and denied the rumours.“There is no rift or anything there,” Hussey said in an interview to Indian Express. “Actually, I think there is a bit of bromance there and they are pretty close which is fantastic for the group,” he further added.“Karthik is a straightforward person who backs his teammates to get the job done. It’s a good sign of leadership. He is high maintenance at times because he loves the game of cricket. There is no malice… he only cares about winning the game,” the 42-year-old further said.Hussey also added that pair of Eoin Morgan and Dinesh Karthik will give KKR good leadership this year in the IPL. “Morgan is a classy-middle order player. Along with DK, I am sure it will be a fantastic partnership on the field. DK from behind the stumps and Morgan can be sort of the vice-captain and help the bowlers out in certain situations. He will fit in perfectly,” Hussey said.The two-time champions KKR will look to win their third IPL trophy when the tournament kicks off from September 19th.

Updated: Sep 15, 2020 23:52 ISTAfghan spinner Rashid Khan is the quintessential T20 bowler. The all-rounder made his international debut in the year 2015 and in these five years he has become one of the most respected limited overs bowlers of his time. Rashid, who started as a mystery spinner, has grown his repertoire by adding loads of variations in his bowling which makes him tough to pick. Add to that his big hitting skills down the order and athleticism on the field and you have a complete modern day cricketer.His performances on the pitch have inspired Afghanistan to become the fifth Asian country to get Test status, after a plethora of memorable performances in white ball cricket. One of the most sort after cricketers in T20 leagues around the world, Rashid plays for Sunrisers Hyderabad in the Indian Premier League and has been a star performer for them over the years.ALSO READ: ‘Have heard Gilchrist say really good things’: AB de Villiers names batsman who has ‘a lot of similarities’ with himSeen as someone who has inspired an entire generation of Afghan youth to take up cricket, Rashid said that he feels blessed and lucky to have got the opportunity help change the mindset of the youth in the war torn nation.“It feels amazing to be someone who is changing the life of youngsters. To be someone who is helping change their mindset and plans about what they want to become in the future,” Rashid told Indian off spinner R Ashwin on the latter’s youtube show DRS with Ashwin.“They were not busy in sports and were not too much interested in sports. They were mostly interested in other activities which were not good for the country also.“It’s a huge honour for me to be someone who is helping them change,” he added.Rashid has picked up 133 wickets in 71 ODIs and 89 wickets in 48 T20 internationals.
Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology (MNNIT)-Allahabad will play a key role in counseling and admission to undergraduate degree programmes of engineering, technology, and architecture including BTech courses in all NITs, IIITs and other government-funded institutions of the country based on JEE (Main) scores this year.MNNIT director Prof Rajeev Tripathi has been appointed chairman of the Central Seat Allocation Board (CSAB) by the union ministry of education.As a result, a dedicated CSAB headquarters will soon become functional at MNNIT Allahabad campus with a team of institute officials and staff to shouldering the responsibilities of counselling for 2020-21.For admissions, the Education ministry sets up a Joint Seat Allocation Authority (JoSAA) to manage and regulate the joint seat allocation for admissions to participating institutes for each academic year. Last year this included 23 IITs, 31 NITs, 25 IIITs, and 28 other-government funded technical institutes (Other-GFTIs). Admission to all the academic programs offered by these Institutes will be made through a single platform.The CSAB simultaneously undertakes counselling for admission to NITs, IIITs, and other JEE participating institutes, and based on this the candidates need to report to the allotted institutes and take admission.However, after it, when still seats remain vacant, the CSAB then conducts a special round of counselling for remaining seats. For the close work that CSAB does along with JoSAA in counselling and admissions, the chairman of CSAB is also a member of JoSAA, inform officials.The core committee of CSAB has a representative of Education ministry, directors of four NITs, and one IIIT also as members.“All though it is the first time MNNIT is shouldering the responsibility of CSAB, it was the institute that had kick-started the online counselling process for admissions in coordination with National Informatics Centre (NIC). It handled the role of CSAB’s former version of CCB or Central Counselling Board in 2002 and 2003 with success. In 2004 the responsibility was given to Delhi College of Engineering before the task against being entrusted to MNNIT in 2008. However, this time this responsibility has come to MNNIT after a gap of 12 years now,” shared MNNIT director, Prof Rajeev Tripathi.Last year, the responsibility of CSAB was handled by NIT-Trichy, he added.Prof Tripathi said that JEE (Advanced) is scheduled to be held on September 27 and after its result declaration, the process of online registration and choice locking for admissions will kick start from October 6 and continue till October 16.The first round of seat allotment would then take place on October 17. “In these tough times of Covid-19 pandemic, to maintain social distancing, physical reporting has been eliminated. Due to this, radical change has been inducted in business rules in terms of online reporting, online document verification, and online admission, keeping the safety of the aspirants and stakeholders on priority,” he said.Some of the important features of the seat allocation process for admission through JoSAA-2020 includes: Seat allocation process this year would involve six normal rounds, to be conducted by JoSAA-2020 for admission to IITs and NIT+ system, which will be followed by two special vacant seats filling rounds, to be conducted by CSAB– 2020, only for ‘NIT+ system’.
Exactly 60 years ago, on September 19, 1960, the Indus Waters Treaty between Pakistan and India was signed. Despite the energy and voluminous paperwork that marked eight long years of negotiations, under the aegis of the World Bank (WB), the Treaty was largely viewed by both parties as one which gave away their respective water interests. The two leaders — Jawaharlal Nehru and Ayub Khan — for different reasons felt otherwise and soaked in the historic moment of the signing ceremony in Karachi on September 19, 1960. As a military dictator, Khan’s diktat overrode public opinion, while the democratic Nehru had to contend with domestic opposition.The Treaty partitioned the Indus system of rivers. The three eastern rivers (Beas, Ravi and Sutlej) with a mean annual flow of 33 million-acre feet (maf) went to India while the control of over 80 maf of waters of the western rivers (Indus, Chenab and Jhelum) was granted to Pakistan. In terms of volume, however, 80.52% of water went to Pakistan and only 19.48% came to India. The ratio of 4:1 favoured Pakistan and India’s initial demand for 25% was raised in the Lok Sabha as a failure of its negotiations.Many newspapers in India castigated the government for giving in to Pakistan and making “concessions after concessions”. Some parliamentarians felt that had India conceded to Pakistan’s water requirements in 1948, as a “human consideration”, the Treaty would possibly not have been required. As things developed, Pakistan’s demand became bigger and bolder. “I wish,” said Harish Mathur, a Congressman from Rajasthan, in the Lok Sabha, “our government takes note of the feeling in this country. It is not that our over-generousness should be at the cost of the development of this country.”As the debate grew, Nehru was presented with some uncomfortable facts. First, the unfairness of the terms; second, the cost of the replacement of canal works; and, third, the overall context of India-Pakistan relations. Of the cultivable land in India, only 19% had irrigation facilities while in Pakistan it was 54%. Fundamentally, therefore, India was left with less-irrigated land and even fewer irrigation facilities. This could hardly be justified as fair to India. “It is a kind of second partition which we are experiencing...this is being done again with the signature of our honourable prime minister,” argued Ashok Mehta of the Praja Socialist Party.The money allocated was equally disadvantageous. Pakistan was to get grants and not loans of about ₹400 crore of the Rs 450 crore required to build its link canals; India would get Rs 27 crore of the overall requirement of Rs 100 crore to build infrastructure. The money was to be given as loans and not grants — Rs 15 crore from the United States (US) and Rs 12 crore from WB. But this was not all. India’s commitment to pay Rs 83 crore to Pakistan in pound sterling, without settling earlier financial dues with that country was incomprehensible to the Lok Sabha. Considering the desperate foreign exchange position in India, it was foolhardy to agree to this. In terms of adjustment of debts that Pakistan owed India, only Rs 6 crore as dues for the waters that India spared over the years was adjusted.Despite all this, Nehru had a different take. He felt he was looking at the larger foreign policy picture. He emphasised, “It is the context that we have to consider, not a particular bit.” In the political environment of the 1950s, Nehru was not averse to reaching out for peace and tranquillity. These were requisites, he strongly felt, for the stability and development that India desired. It was not that he was blinded by reconciliation with Pakistan. After all, in 1959, when Ayub Khan advocated a “common defence” in which both India and Pakistan would come together to guard the subcontinent, Indian leaders such as Jayaprakash Narayan and C Rajagopalachari welcomed the idea. Even General KM Cariappa was not entirely opposed to this. It was Nehru who cold-shouldered it by famously retorting “defence against whom?”. In the case of the Treaty, however, he felt it was a price worth paying and expressed his disappointment that the House treated it with such “a narrow-minded spirit” and tactfully praised the engineers “who fought for India’s interest strenuously” to take the heat off the debate.However much Nehru tried to separate himself as the proponent of a broad perspective from the nitty-gritty of negotiations, there was an undeniable Nehruvian internationalist mindset to the whole water issue with Pakistan. His ideals of oneness though clashed with the realities of power politics and interest-oriented relations which he understood, but adamantly refused to accept. The goodwill and friendship that India hoped to gain from the generosity and sacrifice it had shown to Pakistan were belied by Khan’s statements. Soon after signing the Treaty, he talked about the physical possession of the upper reaches of the Indus basin rivers. The Indus Waters Treaty may have prevented “another Korea”, as WB had anxiously observed, but it did not fundamentally change Pakistan’s lower riparian angst nor in its perception of the upper riparian dominance of India.Uttam Kumar Sinha is fellow, Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, New DelhiThe views expressed are personal
Actors Renuka Shahane and Ashutosh Rana have opened up about their love story and revealed how it took them three calls to reveal personal phone numbers and three months before they actually began dating. Actor couple Renuka and Ashutosh will be seen as guests on The Kapil Sharma Show and will share their love story with fans. Renuka and Ashutosh have been married for 19 years.Renuka and Ashutosh first met at the premiere of Hansal Mehta’s debut directorial, Jayate. Ashutosh asked for her phone number from director Ravi Rai who wanted to make a show with both the actors.A Mumbai Mirror report quoted Ashutosh as saying, “He (Ravi) warned me that Renuka doesn’t pick up unknown numbers or check her phone after 10 pm. He was right. I left a (Dussehra) wish on her answering machine, with my name but not my number, hoping she’ll find a way to contact me.”Adding that Renuka quickly called him back to wish him, Ashutosh further said, “I left another message on her machine to thank her for wishing me and the following day, she finally shared her personal number with my sister. For the next three months, we played phone a friend.”When Ashutosh wanted to confess his love for her, he recited a poem which ended with a question. “She paused for a second and finally confessed that she was in love with me too,” Ashutosh added.The couple celebrated their 19th wedding anniversary in March this year and Ashutosh wrote a few beautiful lines of poetry for her. “You are my love requests, you are the meaning of life. You are my highest consciousness, and you are the extension of it. Forever yours, thank you from my heart,” he wrote.About her marriage, Renuka had said last year, “Our worlds are poles apart. He is from a rural region in Madhya Pradesh and I am born and raised in Mumbai. There are a lot of differences. He comes from a joint family; I am from a nuclear family. He comes from a very patriarchal family, but the respect all the women in my married family and I have received is immense.”
The YS Jagan Mohan Reddy government on Friday announced an increase in the prices of petrol and diesel by Re 1 per litre in the name of road cess, a move aimed at shoring up the state’s finances hit by the Covid pandemic.An ordinance seeking to amend the APVAT Act, 2005, was promulgated by state governor Biswabhushan Harichandan in the evening, providing for levy and collection of a road development cess of one rupee per litre on petrol and diesel.According to special chief secretary (revenue) Rajat Bhargava, the economic activity has come to a halt in the state ever since lockdown was imposed due to Covid-19 pandemic, affecting the revenues of the State during the months of April, May, June and July.In April, the revenue realised in the state was only Rs 1,323 crore as against Rs 4,480 crore in April 2019 which accounts for only 29.5% of the total expected revenue. Similar trends were observed for the months of May, June, July and August also, he said.Besides the fall in revenues, the Government of India has also not released the GST compensation for the year 2020-21 so far. While the stress on revenues from all sources continued, there is steep increase in the expenditure relating to the health services for combating Covid-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the government is also implementing several schemes for the welfare of people from downtrodden sections.“The twin impact of fall in revenues and enhanced expenditure on health services and welfare schemes has impacted the capital expenditure on infrastructure development,” Bhargava said.Taking all the factors into consideration and keeping in view the necessity of allocating dedicated funds to the road development in the state, the state government has decided to levy “Road Development Cess” of Re 1 per litre on petrol and diesel in addition to the existing levies on the two products in public interest, the official said.“The proceeds of the Road Development Cess which will be around Rs 500 crore per annum shall be transferred to the Andhra Pradesh Road Development Corporation for exclusive use in developing road infrastructure,” he added.Last week, the Jagan government increased the VAT on natural gas from 14.5 per cent to 24.5 per cent. Earlier in July, it increased the cess on petrol from Rs 2.76 to Rs 4 (an increase of Rs 1.24 per litre), apart from VAT of 31% and on diesel from Rs 3.07 to Rs 4 (an increase of 93 paisa per litre), apart from a VAT pf 22.25%, stating that the state’s own revenues had dried up due to Covid-19 pandemic situation.

Updated: Sep 18, 2020 18:32 ISTActor Abhishek Bachchan has had two milestones in 2020 so far — making his web debut with Breathe Into The Shadows and receiving good reviews, and also hitting the 20 year mark in his career. And now, he’ll see another first — witnessing the OTT release of his film, The Big Bull.There’s been a debate over whether this is the way forward, with theatres still closed, or whether filmmakers should wait for theatres to reopen. Bachchan feels there’s no debate in the first place.“The media has made it into a debate. There are opinions. I don’t know if this discussion would be happening if we weren’t in the middle of a pandemic. But circumstances are such that we have to do whatever best we can,” he says.The way he looks at it, at the end of the day, the 44-year-old adds, “I want my work and film out to as many people possible. If that’s in a movie theatre, I’d like as many people to come and watch it. If it’s a streaming platform, as many to come there to see it. I want them to see my films without compromising their safety. If during these unprecedented times, I have an avenue through which I can do that, I am more than happy.”Interestingly, his father, actor Amitabh Bachchan, too, saw his illustrious career’s first direct-to-OTT release with Gulabo Sitabo in May this year. Abhishek confesses that the two haven’t even talked about it.“I think as actor, we like to believe, and if I may speak for him, we’re just happy to have a job and get to share our creativity with the audience. We discuss everything. Apart from being my father, he is my best friend, and we talk about everything. It would be unnatural if you didn’t talk about how your day went, what are you planning to do. We bounce ideas off each other,” he tells us.Given he belongs to a lineage like his, people may think that he must have had it all easy. But he in fact said recently that getting his first film, Refugee(2000) itself was a struggle for him.On this, he elaborates, “Why it was a struggle, I don’t know, you will have to ask people, I won’t be able to answer it. But everybody does, and that’s just the way of the industry. Nothing is going to come easy to you, you have to work hard for anything that you want, and that’s the way of the world. That’s absolutely fine.”Interact with the author on Twitter/ @RishabhSuri02
The OTT platforms have gained prominence more than ever before amid the pandemic as several films with big star cast, originally slated for theatrical releases, have been beelining to get a digital releases. While Akshay Oberoi is all for OTTs being a favoured medium, he hopes it does not become driven by big names like in the world of theatrical films.“That would not be ideal. When a film releases in theatres, we often hear people say that ‘Oh itni mehengi picture, itne bade naam hain, par bekaar hai.’ There are a whole lot of things that can go wrong when you are in this star system. Recently, a prominent producer who is a close friend told me something that people have made project in the past thinking Hrithik ki dates khaali hain, uske liye picture likho,” Oberoi shares.The 35-year-old says the best part about the OTT platforms is that people are writing and casting authentic people. “There is not name no PR image that is taken into consideration while casting. The audience is also attracted to this. It would be damaging to get star system on OTT platforms. It will spoil what good is coming from them,” he says adding, “but you never know because at the end of the day everyone is trying to make business out of it.”However, Oberoi, who has starred in a number of OTT projects including It’s Not That Simple, Bar Code, The Test Case, Selection Day and the latest Flesh, is hopeful.“So far it has all been good. The OTT actors are good and not concerned with the game of stardom,” the Gurgaon (2016) actor.While he is someone who embraced the digital platform way back in 2015, Oberoi is surprised to see how quickly it has penetrated the lives of people, especially in the past 6 months amid the pandemic.“I knew that OTT was the future when I started doing it but Covid has accelerated that process. I am so glad I joined the platform early. I didn’t know that Itni jaldi cheezein turn ho jaayengi I think the silver lining of coronavirus is that people have realized the significance and comfort of consuming content is online. Now the number of people are watching content online is so huge, even cinemas don’t get that kind of numbers,” he concludes.
We were en route to Ramvan from Chakrata, the broken-down hill road shrouded in silence. Suddenly, we heard a scream. We moved forward to find a number of soldiers in military attire near a cave on a hilltop. A rope stretched from the cave down to the road. An instructor was training them to descend from the top using the rope. Before beginning the descent, the soldiers had to utter a loud cry.We stopped. While they took a break, I asked the instructor the name of the unit. He replied that this was the Special Frontier Force (SFF), and said most of the soldiers in his force were Tibetans. During the ensuing conversation, I found that they were angry with China and were waiting to take on any aggression by that country. More than three decades have passed, but the incident has stayed with me.Today, when there is tension on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China, the spotlight is on SFF. This force was relatively unknown. It was strategically kept in the background during the 1971 Bangladesh War on the Chittagong Hill; in 1984 during the hoisting of the Tricolour at Siachen; and in the Kargil War in 1999. The Army has not made any official statements about this, but it is no secret that SFF soldiers have captured inaccessible peaks on the southern banks of Pangong Tso. The force which occupies the highest peak in a war gets an automatic tactical edge.This is the first time that India has taken such action on the China border. Earlier, through Balakot and the surgical strikes, the Narendra Modi government sent a message to not just Pakistan but others across the border. It was decided that any incursion on the Line of Control (LoC) would be answered decisively and in kind. We have been trying to resolve both Pakistan-sponsored terrorism and Chinese incursions at the diplomatic level until now. Now, the army will respond to the action and the diplomatic establishment will convey our position to our adversaries and others through dialogue. But unfortunately, Chinese president Xi Jinping seem to have failed to grasp the implications of this strategy.In this light, defence minister’s Rajnath Singh visiting Moscow twice in the last three months is not surprising. Last week, he went there for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation meeting. China’s defence minister, Wei Fenghe, was also there. Talks were not scheduled between them, but Wei took the initiative with Russia pushing for it as well. This is the first high-level dialogue amid the tensions at the border. A government statement said that Singh asked China to respect LAC while China sought to blame India for the border tensions. However, Wei also suggested that both sides maintain communications at all levels. We cannot let down our guard. China rarely lives up to its promises — the deaths of Indian soldiers from Rezang La to Galwan is proof of that.The Rajnath visit is important in the light of our dependence on Russia for essential military supplies and the historic ties between the two countries. Russia has always supported India during the wars with Pakistan, but now things have changed. Hence, the need to renew the bond.It is said that decisions on war are made on the negotiating table. This means that if negotiations are done first, war can be avoided. And now, foreign minister, S Jaishankar, will meet Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi in Moscow on September 10. Is Moscow going to add a new chapter in India’s strategic history after Tashkent?Even if China had not encroached into our territory, India had to still acquire the power to deal with it. The Pentagon revealed, in a report this week, that China is looking to double its nuclear stockpile in ten years. It has ambitions to build military bases in the United Arab Emirates, Kenya, Tanzania, Seychelles, Angola, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, Singapore and Indonesia. China claims that it has the largest navy in the world. While we have made some gains through diplomacy in the neighbourhood and held the Chinese back, the challenge will persist.It is said of World War II that if Hitler had been prevented from advancing from Munich, the war would not have taken place. The fear of another great war can be allayed if the world makes a serious effort to stop Xi Jinping’s expansionism. Perhaps this is why the United States (US) has increased the deployment of ships and warplanes in Diego Garcia and the South China Sea. The manner in which the Chinese foreign ministry has conducted itself recently is telling. Earlier this week, when the Czech Republic criticised it, Beijing sent out a warning that Prague would regret this. Australia has also been threatened in the same manner. Chinese spokespersons even signalled that China could make things worse for India than in 1962. This overconfidence is dangerous for China. It should know that India has changed a lot between 1962 and 2020. The peaks of southern Pangong bear witness to this. Beijing cannot be unaware of these realities.Shashi Shekhar is the editor-in-chief, HindustanThe views expressed are personal

Actor Ranvir Shorey has said that there is a group of seven or eight people who always come out to defend Bollywood whenever someone talks of unfair practices in the film industry. Ranvir’s statements have come amid the debate kick-started by Kangana Ranaut when she claimed that 99% of Bollywood uses drugs and called the industry a ‘gutter’.The actor told a news channel that there are people who believe in projecting a white-washed image of Bollywood to the world. Recently, Ranvir had also tweeted in response to Jaya Bachchan’s statement in the Parliament where she slammed people who were speaking against the film industry.Adding that he has a problem with people defending the wrong practices, Ranvir told Aaj Tak, “I have a problem with such people who defend the unfair practices. I have seen it first hand. If we always sweep these issues under the carpet, how shall we address and end these? That is why I said that people who defend all of this are either those people who believe they own the industry, khud ko zameendar samajhte hain (they think of themselves as landlords). Or, these people want to please those in power.”Jaya had said in the Parliament, “People in the entertainment industry are being flogged by social media. People who made their names in the industry have called it a gutter. I completely disagree. I hope that the government tells such people not to use this kind of language.”Asked why people avoid talking about the problems, Ranvir added, “People do not want to speak because they fear they won’t receive any more work. Of course, I have been at the receiving end. I tried pleasing them in the starting but it has been long since I quit that dream. I am no longer here to please those people or join that cool group. I was sidelined and manipulated. I decided to accept the smaller roles and thought that all this is not worth killing my conscience.”“I am happy with the small roles, films and thankfully, now , series. I am happy with these rewards now,” he said.Ranvir had tweeted, “The ones who come out defending the muck in #Bollywood are either the ‘gatekeepers’, or the ones sucking up to them. If you don’t like someone whistleblowing or using their freedom of expression, you’re free to use your freedom of enabling. Don’t see what the fuss is about..”
Over the past week, there have been both a series of developments in eastern Ladakh and a series of statements from India’s top decision-makers. In terms of events, India has pre-empted a possible Chinese intrusion and positioned forces at strategically important points. In terms of statements, the Chief of Defence staff, Bipin Rawat said that the military option was on the table — and more recently, has highlighted the threat of “coordinated action” from both China and Pakistan. And external affairs minister S Jaishankar has emphasised the importance of finding a resolution in the domain of diplomacy.Unpacking these events and statements provides a glimpse into how India has decided to approach the Chinese aggression. For one, there is absolute clarity that the Chinese have flouted border agreements, intruded into Indian territory, and the onus rests on them to both disengage and de-escalate and India will resist the incursion. Two, there is a recognition that China‘s behaviour is not just India-specific but in line with its pattern of aggression elsewhere — and this is because Beijing sees an opportunity to change the rules of the game even as the world struggles with the pandemic (that began in China) and the United States (US) remains distracted with domestic elections. The corollary of this is that when the geopolitical situation changes, and international opinion continues to build against it, China may be forced to review its approach. Three, while there is a sense that China will be India’s most critical longer-term challenge, in the immediate context, countering it will require a host of strategies — ensuring effective military mobilisation to send a message of strength; inflicting economic costs to send a signal that the entire relationship is in jeopardy; cementing international partnerships to build pressure; and pursuing bilateral dialogue to find an acceptable solution.The latest developments are in line with this broad approach. India has made tactical military advances — which sends a message of military determination. It has continued banning Chinese apps — and Huawei can well write off its 5G prospects in the Indian market. It has reiterated its commitment to Quad. The defence ministers of the two countries met in Moscow on Friday. And Mr Jaishankar has confirmed that he will meet the Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi in Moscow next week. The ball is now entirely in China‘s court — it needs to decide if it wants to rescue the relationship or ruin it.
According to data released by the National Statistical Office on Monday, India’s GDP contracted by a staggering 23.9% in the April-June quarter. The contraction is larger than the 19.2% figure projected by a Bloomberg poll of economists. And it shows that the nation-wide lockdown, which was in place in April and May, has taken a heavy toll on economic activity. An examin-ation of Gross Value Added (GVA) figures, which is GDP minus taxes, shows that the non-farm economy has suffered a contraction, including public admini-stration, defence and other services. In an unusual development, the GDP growth numbers are lower than GVA, which means that taxes have also contracted. Experts believe that the first estimates could see further downward revision as informal sector numbers become available at a later stage.Krishnamurthy Subramanian, the Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) to the ministry of finance, while reacting to the numbers, said that they reflected the exogenous economic shock of the pandemic. He claimed that the economy was already in the process of achieving a V-shaped recovery. High frequency indicators for August do suggest that things are improving. However, it is important to differentiate between a sequential and annual recovery. The real question is not whether the subsequent GDP numbers show a smaller contraction than 23.9%. What matters is a return to pre-pandemic income levels. Most experts believe that this is not likely in the next few quarters, maybe even years.The government must adopt a two-pronged approach immediately. One, as this newspaper has argued, it must announce a second fiscal stimulus — and soon — for that is the only way to spur demand. This deployment of additional public resources must be done smartly. For instance, the government’s own survey suggests that at least three-fourths of micro, small and medium enterprises were using less than half of their productive capacity as on August 1. Can the stimulus be geared towards boosting this sector? Or would a direct cash transfer to citizens work better? Two, as Covid-19 cases continue to increase, even the ongoing sequential recovery may get jeopardised. India’s battle against Covid-19 is critically dependent on how state governments handle the challenge. They need resources to perform on this front. This is why it is necessary that the Centre resolves the ongoing Goods and Service Tax compensation payment dispute with the states in an amicable manner. Till India gets its post-pandemic economy right, its developmental and global ambitions will remain unmet.
Updated: Sep 19, 2020 21:39 ISTIn his reply to the Uttar Pradesh police’s summoning notice, the Aam Aadmi Party leader Sanjay Singh on Saturday said that he was ready to get arrested but chief minister Yogi Adityanath was not even keen on taking a statement.“Yogi ji, I was ready to get arrested, but you are not even ready to take a statement. But that’s okay, two days after the Monsoon Session ends, I will come to Lucknow’s Hazratganj police station,” Sanjay Singh tweeted in Hindi.योगी जी मैं तो गिरफ़्तारी देने को तैयार था आप बयान लेने को भी तैयार नही कोई बात नही सदन का सत्र ख़त्म होने के दो दिन बाद मैं लखनऊ के हज़रतगंज थाने आ जाऊँगा। pic.twitter.com/tbecmS8FMk — Sanjay Singh AAP (@SanjayAzadSln) September 19, 2020The AAP lawmaker has been summoned to appear before the UP Police in connection with a sedition case filed against him.The Uttar Pradesh police lodged a First Information Report (FIR) against Singh on September 1 under various sections of the IPC at Hazratganj police station for conducting a survey.The notice sent to Singh on his New Delhi address also mentions charges under IPC 124 A, 153 A (promoting enmity between classes), and 153 B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national integration).
Fresh restrictions on social gatherings in England, potentially involving limiting pub opening hours, appear to be on the cards soon as the British government seeks to suppress a sharp spike in new coronavirus infections.British Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Friday that the country has to “come together” over the coming weeks to get on top of the spike, which he noted is leading to a doubling in the number of people being hospitalized with the virus every seven to eight days.“We want to avoid a national lockdown altogether, that is the last line of defense,” he told BBC radio. “It is not the proposal that’s on the table.”According to the BBC, the British government’s chief scientific adviser and medical officer warned of another serious coronavirus outbreak and many more deaths by the end of October if there were no further interventions. Possible measures are said to include asking some hospitality businesses to close, or limiting opening hours.The testing that is being conducted has already seen a sharp increase in cases over the past couple of weeks that have raised fears that the country with Europe’s deadliest coronavirus outbreak may be in for a second wave during the winter. Critics say it has lost control of the virus and that’s why new measures are being introduced.Already this week, a ban on social gatherings of more than six people, including children, has come into effect for England. The other nations of the U.K. — Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland — have announced similar clampdowns on meetings.Tougher restrictions on people and businesses in parts of northeastern England have also been announced, and there is speculation that an area in northwest England will see fresh curbs on Friday.The latest daily figures show that another 3,395 new confirmed cases were reported. That down on the previous day’s 3,991, the seven-day average is around double the level a couple of weeks back.As the experience of the pandemic has shown, there’s usually a lag of a week or two between a rise in cases and hospitalizations and then a subsequent lag for deaths.It’s clear that the increase in cases is leading to a higher number of people requiring acute care. The number of patients being treated for the disease in hospitals in England increased to 894 on Wednesday, up from 472 on Sept. 1, according to the latest government statistics. The number of hospitalized patients on ventilators rose to 107 from 59 in the same period.The worry is that deaths will start to increase markedly in the days and weeks ahead. Though the U.K. is recording far fewer deaths on a daily basis than it did earlier this year, it still registered another 21 on Thursday, taking the total of those having died 28 days after testing positive for Covid-19 to 41,705.“This is a big moment for the country,” Hancock said. “We are seeing an acceleration in the number of cases and we are also seeing that the number of people hospitalized with coronavirus is doubling every eight days.”The government’s strategy over the coming weeks, he said, is to contain the virus down as much as is possible whilst ensuring schools and workplaces remain open.“And doing everything we possibly can for the cavalry that’s on the horizon of the vaccine and mass testing, and the treatments that, frankly, this country has done more than any other around the world to develop,” he said.
U.S. drug developer Novavax Inc said on Tuesday it was doubling its potential Covid-19 vaccine manufacturing capacity to two billion doses annually under an agreement with Serum Institute of India, sending its shares up about 7%.In August, Novavax signed a deal with Serum Institute, the world’s largest producer of vaccines, to produce a minimum of one billion doses of its vaccine candidate, when approved, for low- and middle-income countries and India.As part of the expanded agreement, Serum Institute will also manufacture the antigen component of the vaccine, dubbed NVX‑CoV2373, which Novavax said will bring its manufacturing capacity to over two billion doses by mid-2021.Novavax’s vaccine is currently in mid-stage trials after an early-stage study showed it produced high levels of antibodies against the novel coronavirus. The company plans to begin late-stage trials in the third quarter.Last month, Novavax said it will supply 60 million doses of its coronavirus vaccine candidate to the UK beginning as early as the first quarter of 2021.The company is also preparing to deliver 100 million doses to the United States by January after it was awarded $1.6 billion for its potential vaccine, and has also signed supply agreements with Canada and Japan.Other drugmakers such as Pfizer Inc and Moderna Inc have already begun large late-stage studies of their experimental vaccines.
Domestic equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty ended on a flat note on Friday amid lack of fresh buying triggers and mixed global cues.The 30-share BSE Sensex ended 14.23 points or 0.04 per cent higher at 38,854.55. The broader NSE Nifty rose 15.20 points or 0.13 per cent to close at 11,464.45.SBI was the top gainer in the Sensex pack, spurting over 2 per cent, followed by TCS, Tech Mahindra, HUL, Bajaj Finance, Kotak Bank and Titan.On the other hand, IndusInd Bank, PowerGrid, Bharti Airtel, Asian Paints and HDFC Bank were among the laggards.The markets remained cautious on adverse news-flows of Covid-19 vaccine trials, Sino-India geopolitical tensions and sell-off in US equities, said Sanjeev Zarbade, VP PCG Research, Kotak Securities.During the talks between External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on Thursday evening, India and China agreed on a five-point roadmap including quick disengagement of troops and avoiding any action that could escalate tensions for resolving the four-month-long face-off in eastern Ladakh.Foreign portfolio investors sold equities worth USD 528 million over the past five trading sessions while domestic institutional investors sold USD 109 million worth of stocks, Zarbade stated.“While the market is not in a bubble zone, we note that global cues (US markets on correction mode) have started to turn negative and FIIs have turned sellers along with domestic mutual funds,” he added. Bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Seoul ended on a positive note, while stock exchanges in Europe saw a mixed trend.Global oil benchmark Brent crude was trading 0.35 per cent lower at USD 39.92 per barrel.In the forex market, the rupee depreciated 7 paise to close at 73.53 against the US dollar.

I got to play such high-level cricket with legendary cricketers. My experience also grew on how to treat a match on its merit.”
The Bombay high court at Goa has upheld the acquittal of the six persons charged with procuring, assembling and transporting a bomb to Margao in South Goa, where it prematurely exploded killing two persons who were allegedly ferrying it on the eve of Diwali in 2009.The two deceased -- Malgonda Patil and Yogesh Naik -- were allegedly carrying the bomb in their scooter with the intent to place it at a site where a Diwali eve competition was being held on October 16, 2009. Besides Patil and Naik, who died while ferrying the bomb, no one else was injured in the blast that took place behind Grace Church in Margao.Besides Patil and Naik, six others were charged by the NIA including Vinay Talekar, Dhananjay Ashtekar, Prashant Ashtekar, Vinayak Patil, Prashant Juvekar and Dilip Mazgaonkar, all hailing from Maharashtra and with connections to the Sanatan Sanstha. They were charged by the Goa Police crime branch. The case was later handed over to the National Investigation Agency.“Today the HC has passed a judgement [in the] appeal filed by the NIA challenging the judgement passed by a special judge acquitting the accused in the blast case. The High Court has considered [the case] in larger detail [and has] now held that the benefit of doubt is given,” Advocate for the NIA Pravin Faldessai, said.“The special judge had said that there were malafides (bad faith) by the investigating agency... those remarks are now expunged,” he added.Also Read: Goa: German woman found dead by daughter in her flatA total eleven persons were named as accused in the case including the two who died when the bomb exploded prematurely. Besides Naik, who died, all the others hailed from Maharashtra and were associated with the Sanatan Sanstha, a far-right organisation accused of organising the bomb blast with the motive to disrupt the Narakasur celebrations that are held on the eve of Diwali. Three accused are absconding. Only six accused faced trial.On the day prior to Diwali, giant effigies of the demon king Narakasur, are erected with pomp and loud music before they are consigned to flames in the wee hours to signify the victory of good over evil.Also Read: AAP’s Goa convener steps down, calls it ‘strategic decision’“We had to prove that this particular Sanstha had the motive to conduct this blast so that there is an (environment of) terror formed in the state of Goa and in the Union of India, but the court said that there (was) no proof and there is no strong proof that we could submit before the court,” Faldessai added.“What we had produced before the special judge was that their intention was to stop this competition not because they didn’t want competition at all, but that their intention was that Lord Krishna should be given more importance and not Narakasur,” Faldessai said.“Their thing was that Hindu Sanskriti has to be protected and Diwali has to be celebrated in a better manner and not in Narakasur competitions etc,” he said.
On Tuesday, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) filed a charge sheet in the Pulwama terror attack case. It has formally named 19 people, including the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed chief, Masood Azhar, for planning and carrying out the attack on the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) convoy, killing 40 security personnel. Azhar’s nephew, Mohammad Umar Farooq, was sent to Kashmir to execute the bombing and was in touch with the Jaish leadership back in Pakistan, during, before and after the attack, according to the charge sheet. One of Azhar’s brother also told Farooq, who was killed in an encounter subsequently, that the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) wanted Jaish operatives to find out about Indian Air Force bases; Jaish was also planning a second terror attack after Pulwama, but had to abort it due to international pressure on Pakistan.Pulwama was a defining moment for geopolitics in South Asia. Despite Pakistan’s strenuous denials, it was clear then — and it is clearer now — that the attack had the clear sanction of the Pakistani establishment. A set of observers, at that point, wanted to make a distinction between the Pakistani government and terror-based groups. But while it is still at the charge sheet stage, the NIA investigation has shown that this is an artificial distinction — and in fact, there was a very high degree of synergy and coordination between the Pakistani military intelligence and terror groups based in Pakistan. It also shows that Pakistan was more than willing to escalate the situation with another terror attack, but the Balakot retaliatory attack (framed diplomatically as a “pre-emptive strike”) and the concerted international diplomatic pressure, mobilised effectively by India, forced Rawalpindi to back off.The international community today recognises Pakistan has given patronage to terror groups and supports terrorism as a State policy — but it has vacillated between appeasing Islamabad-Rawalpindi and penalising it in a somewhat half-hearted manner. Pakistan remains a key source of global instability, and any country — including its best friend, China — which wants stability must force Pakistan to act against terror. For India, the lesson is simple. In terms of security, New Delhi must never let its guard down, for Pakistan’s intent is clear. In terms of individuals, letting Azhar get away in 1999 (after the IC-814 hijack) has proved to be enormously costly; such an error must not be repeated. In terms of diplomacy, India must be alert to the joint China-Pakistani project of undermining India and counter it across platforms.
How can India vaccinate a billion-plus people? How would the system work?First, the government will maintain a list of approved vaccines. This list will change, as some get dropped, and others get approved.Second, the government will set a rate per vaccination for each vaccine. Finally, after due diligence, it will create a list of Authorised Vaccinators. These could be government hospitals, reputed private hospitals, diagnostic chains, even pharmacies.Another ecosystem will have to be nurtured to train and certify a few hundred thousand people on how to administer vaccines. Specifications and templates will be distributed for vaccination stations which can be permanent, pop-up, or mobile for making it available anywhere. The government will distribute a standard vaccination software on smartphones and laptops, for the data of every vaccination to be captured in real-time and sent to a central database with proper security, privacy and encryption.With this approach, at least 100,000 vaccination stations can be set up across the country over a year, while vaccine production is simultaneously scaled up.A critical requirement will be the supply chain, including cold chain infrastructure. Vaccine sales will be between approved vaccine vendors and the Authorised Vaccinators; they will have to figure out the cold chain. An entire economy could spring up — new mobile cold chains with refrigerated trucks, or repurposed existing cold chains.People should be able to go to any vaccination station in the country anytime to get a shot. They can also book a slot online. People entering a station and then first authenticate themselves using Aadhaar, phone number, any other digitally authenticable ID. A certified vaccinator will vaccinate them. The data from the vaccination will be uploaded. This data will includes the name and ID of the vaccinator and the recipient, details of the vaccine, and the pre-paid voucher (more on this shortly). The money (for administering the shot) will be credited immediately to the Authorised Vaccinator, and the central database will issue an instant digital certificate. The certificate can be downloaded to the person’s smartphone, printed or stored in a digital locker. The whole process should take about 10 minutes. At 50 vaccinations per day per station, India could do five million vaccinations per day.The digital certificate will be globally portable and verifiable. While the idea of an immunity passport has been questioned, a certificate of immunisation is part of the International Health Regulations for diseases such as yellow fever, there is a precedent for such documentation. With this, the vaccinated person would be able to travel anywhere. If we find that vaccines induce limited immunity, then there will be an expiry date on the certificate, and the person will have to get revaccinated. If it is a dual dose vaccine, then only a provisional certificate will be issued, with the date for the second dose mentioned.The system can enable people to get vaccinated at a date, time, and location of their choice. All payments by the people getting vaccinated will be through pre-paid vouchers, and rates could drop over time with volumes. People who can afford it should and will pay for their vaccines. The government will pay to vaccinate all health workers, its employees and their families, and the poor and vulnerable. Payments can be enabled by giving a DBT voucher, which is only accepted for vaccination. Companies could provide vouchers for all their employees and their families. Philanthropies and corporate foundations could also distribute these vaccination vouchers. These vouchers could be digital or printed for those without phones. The government can issue guidelines to streamline procurement from vaccine manufacturers by Authorised Vaccinators.Since monitoring is part of the life cycle of any vaccine, a digital record of vaccination and a link to self-reported side effects could strengthen India’s vaccine safety surveillance. A sophisticated system could be built on top of this vaccination infrastructure using anonymised aggregate data. For example, if there is a rise in cases of Covid-19 in spite of vaccination in some areas, it would indicate that the efficacy of one of the vaccines used is lower than anticipated. A rise in some symptoms would mean there are unexpected side effects. Artificial Intelligence could be used for predictive analysis.Initially, when vaccines are scarce, this system will be rolled out in a small scale and only through Authorised Vaccinators from the government. The initial vaccines will be directed strategically at health care and other essential workers, and the vulnerable.The task ahead is fraught with risks from new vaccines, privacy issues, and objections from those reluctant to get vaccinated. There will be important decisions on equity, inclusion, priority, privacy, and choice. Yet, we have no choice but to go ahead.This system may look daunting, but we are fortunate that India has many digital building blocks which can be used. Apart from the JAM trinity, the payment system UPI can be used to create the infrastructure for pre-paid vouchers. This vaccination system is fully aligned with and will accelerate, the National Digital Health Mission announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on August 15. Everyone can choose to opt for a health ID and an Electronic Health Record along with their vaccination details. The digital vaccination certificate, as well as the electronic health record, can be stored in MEITY’s DigiLocker. The training modules for vaccinators can be set up on IGOT, the online learning portal, launched by the department of personnel and training and hosted on the ministry of education’s Diksha platform.If advanced training is required, the ECHO platform being used by the ministry of health can be leveraged. Best practices can be learnt from the way in which the Election Commission conducts general elections. Call centres and other digital infrastructure created by the National Health Authority can be used to identify and inform those who should get government-funded vaccination based on Ayushman Bharat.The Government e-Marketplace (GEM), set up by the ministry of commerce and industry, can list approved vaccines and prices for Authorised Vaccinators to order their supplies. The ministry of finance has experience in large scale DBT. Importantly, building a new delivery system for public health strengthens the ability of the ministry of health and other ministries such as women and child development to deliver other interventions at scale.Many fine bureaucrats who worked on the Aadhaar project are at senior levels in the government or have just retired and will be happy to come forward to contribute their expertise. And any number of ace technologists will volunteer to make this happen as it is truly an emergency.Vaccinating the whole country as soon and as safely as possible to get things back to some normalcy post-pandemic is the need of the hour. This needs to be accomplished by a national mission, not a departmental or ministry project. All arms of the government and public sector, private sector and civil society need to participate as partners. If we can take this approach, we will set a global benchmark on how to get past the pandemic. A combined response, leveraging each other’s strengths, is self-reliance (atmanirbhar) at its best.(This is the final part of a two-part opinion piece on a possible framework for vaccine delivery in India)Nandan Nilekani, chairman and co-founder of Infosys, was the first chairman of the Unique Identification Authority of India, which set up AadhaarThe views expressed are personal
The Indian Premier League franchises will be heaving a sigh of relief as all the 21 Australian and English players arriving to the UAE from the United Kingdom will have to undergo just 36 hours of quarantine instead of the earlier prescribed six days.All the franchises which have English and Australian players arriving after the white ball series in the UK had appealed for reducing the quarantine period and the BCCI under Sourav Ganguly’s leadership has been able to successfully sort the issue out with local authorities in the UAE.“Yes, I can confirm that all the English and Australian players have to now undergo 36-hour quarantine instead of six days. The matter has been sorted and most of the teams will now have their big stars available from the first game itself,” a senior IPL functionary privy to development told PTI on conditions of anonymity.The likes of Steve Smith, David Warner, Jofra Archer, Jos Buttler will arrive in the UAE late on Thursday night (UAE time) from the UK and on arrival will undergo RT-PCR test for COVID-19.“They have undergone one rapid test before boarding (the flight) and will undergo another on arrival. Otherwise, the robust testing protocols will be followed as usual. The rationale behind the move is that all the players are entering from one bio-bubble to another,” the veteran BCCI official said.The PTI had earlier reported that one of the senior players, an Australian superstar, had written a letter to BCCI president Ganguly requesting for a three-day quarantine, instead of six.The BCCI spoke to the officials of at least three franchises which have Australian and English stars and they seem to be very happy with the outcome.“The BCCI did a great job in reducing the quarantine period to 36 hours. This means teams like Chennai Super Kings (Josh Hazlewood and Tom Curran), Rajasthan Royals (Smith, Buttler, Archer) will have all their players available from their first game. Ditto for Kings XI Punjab that has Glenn Maxwell in its roster and Delhi Capitals that has Alex Carry,” a franchise official said.The only franchise that was unaffected by the six-day quarantine period was Kolkata Knight Riders, which has its first game of the season on September 23 with Eoin Morgan, Tom Banton and Pat Cummins in its ranks.
It took a global pandemic for governments around the world to realise the importance of investing in health care. However, a new study indicates that a lot still needs to be done. According to a Lancet Commission report, for the first time, non-communicable diseases and injuries (NCDIs) have caused more deaths and disability among the world’s poorest billion people. NCDs, a diverse set of diseases that causes premature mortality, results in seven out of every 10 deaths globally. Another key finding is that people with NCDs show increased susceptibility to severe Covid-19 infection, which can lead to death. While countries, especially India, tackle Covid-19 and its economic fallout, they must also begin to direct resources towards other health challenges.The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) seeks to lower death rates related to four NCDs by 2030: Cancer, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease and diabetes. The report highlights the need for governments to show greater commitment. India is one of the 16 countries that has established national NCDI poverty commissions, groups and consortia, indicating its resolve.To reduce death rates, however, requires social, environmental, behavioural, nutritional, and clinical determinants related to NCDs. This includes creating awareness about the causes of NCDs, including alcohol consumption and tobacco usage, among others. These interventions coupled with equitable and effective health care systems are imperative. Covid-19 has exacerbated NCD burdens, but it can be a wake-up call, especially if the government integrates NCDs into the Covid-19 response. This will help reduce the death rate further, and also assist in reaching SDGs.

Union Minister of Education Dr Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank on Thursday said that the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) has recently conducted a survey to understand the scenario of Online Learning of school students amid COVID-19 pandemic and added “NCERT has prepared ‘Alternative Academic Calendar’ and ‘Students’ Learning Enhancement Guidelines’ with a focus on learning outcome” in order to fill the gaps or loss of learning among students.He stated in a reply to an unstarred question over the NCERT survey on online learning amid COVID-19 posed by Jyotiraditya Scindia in the Rajya Sabha.“ The National Council of Education Research and Training (NCERT) has conducted a survey in the month of July, 2020 with the help of Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS), Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (NVS) and CBSE to understand the scenario of Online Learning of school students in COVID-19 pandemic situation. With a view to addressing the issues related to gaps and/or loss of learning among students, during and after the lockdown, NCERT has prepared ‘ Alternative Academic Calendar and Students Learning Enhancement Guidelines with a focus on learning outcome.The guidelines suggest models for the following three types of scenarios:-1. Learning Enhancement during COVID-19 students without digital services.2. Learning Enhancement during COVID-19 for students with limited access to digital devices.3. Learning Enhancement during COVID-19 for students with digital devices.”“The Alternative Academic Calendar and Learning Enhancement guidelines have been shared with all the States, Union Territories, CBSE, KVS, NVS and Central Tibetan Schools Administration (CTSA),” the statement from Union Minister read.Nishank’ on Tuesday released an alternative academic calendar for secondary classes for the next eight weeks as schools continue to be closed in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. This calendar contains class and subject wise in a tabular format. The activities mentioned in the calendar are related to four languages as subject areas--Hindi English, Urdu, and Sanskrit.The calendar also provides space to the strategies of reducing stress and anxiety among students, teachers and parents.
On August 11, the Supreme Court (SC) of India ruled that a daughter has the same rights as a son in an ancestral property under the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005, regardless of when the father may have died, which the principle law – the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 (HSA) – originally did not grant. The 2005 amendment and the subsequent SC ruling are significant steps towards removing gender-based discrimination in HSA. However, the provisions of HSA which govern the devolution of property of a deceased woman are still firmly rooted in outdated assumptions.These provisions treat the Hindu joint family, traditionally led by a patriarch and lineage traced through exclusive male relations, as central to all matters of inheritance. Therefore, HSA tries to retain property within the husband’s family as far as possible when a woman dies childless. This results in unfair discrimination against the woman’s natal family. Even when the woman has acquired the property through her skills and efforts, the husband’s natal family has a stronger claim over it than her parents. However, there is no reciprocal provision for the property belonging to the husband.The notion that the law should preserve property in a Hindu joint family is based on two outdated assumptions. First, that the joint family is the most relevant and important unit of societal organisation among Hindus. Second, that women do not have the wherewithal to acquire and manage their property. Both these assumptions are out of touch with today’s reality.The joint family is becoming increasingly irrelevant as an institution. According to the Census, the average family size of Hindu households reduced from 5.16 persons per household in 2001 to 4.9 persons per household in 2011. According to the Census, the median family size in urban areas has dropped below four. This is part of a larger trend of reduction in family size over the years and shows just how irrelevant joint families have become. Even the Hindu Code Bills committee expressed the same opinion in its 1944 report. BN Rau, the chair of the committee (and who would later play a pivotal role in drafting the Constitution of India), noted that the institution of a Hindu joint family is outdated and should be abolished.The assumption that women do not have the capacity to acquire, hold, and manage their property is refuted by examining the socio-economic status of women today. The Hindu Code Bills committee, however, called this argument specious in its report. Proponents of this argument pointed to the low literacy rate among women as a justification. But the Committee refuted it by pointing out that the literacy rates among men were not significantly higher either. Regardless, HSA, as passed by the Parliament, included the problematic provision.Today, far more women are employed than they were at the time when HSA was enacted. The workforce participation rates for women have increased from 12% in 1971 to 25% in 2011, according to Census figures. The National Family Health Survey (NFHS) 2015-16 reports that 28% of women (between the age of 15-49) own land – either jointly or by themselves – and 37% own a house (jointly or by themselves), 53% of women have savings accounts in banks. They own 21.5% of all proprietary establishments in the country, according to the Union ministry of statistics and programme implementation. Their literacy rate has increased from 9% in 1951 to 65% in 2011. They now represent 46% of the total annual enrolments in higher education, and are 53% of the total post-graduate degrees awarded every year.This change in the status of women demands a fundamental change in the treatment of their property under the law. While some would argue that this provision only kicks in after their death, the lack of ability to provide for their natal family even after their death vis-a-vis a man’s ability to do the same impacts how women’s overall role is perceived in society.Further, there are three demographic trends that add to the urgency of this reform. First, according to the Census 2011, there were 49.5 million women in India who were or had been married, and had no surviving children, up from 24 million in 1981. Second, India’s total fertility rate declined from 5.91 in 1960 to 2.51 in 2017, which means that women have fewer children today than they used to in the past. Third, the number of widowed women in India increased from 24 million in 1961 to 43 million in 2011. The increase in the number of widowed women far outstrips the increase in the number of widowed men. This is likely in part because the average life expectancy for women is higher compared to men, and the rates of remarriage for women are far lower. Put together, this means that the pool of women who are widowed and do not have children will likely be higher in the future than it is today. It is this growing pool of women who are, and will continue to be, affected by HSA’s discriminatory provisions.The assumptions in HSA that govern the devolution of women’s property are no longer valid. We must acknowledge the reality of society and treat women on par with men in all spheres of life, including in matters of property devolution.Devendra Damle is a researcher with NIPFPThe views expressed are personal
Companies, globally, claim with pride that they are meritocracies, places where progression is based on performance and not wealth or connections. However, the more I have worked with companies, the more I find that the reasons of advancement in a company extend beyond terms like meritocracy. And this may not be a bad thing.At the top, when a new chief executive officer (CEO) is appointed, the other internal candidates for CEO leave or are fired. When Jack Welch selected Jeff Immelt to succeed him, Bob Nardelli and Jim McNerney left GE. Other CEOs, who come from outside, often bring in people whom they know, with whom they have chemistry, and who are loyal to them. Outsiders often ask senior people, who must have been strong performers until then, to leave. The ecosystem that the CEO operates under also may create requirements. The CEO may be expected to balance the leadership team across departments, regions, functions, gender, race, age, and length of tenure of individuals. In addition, the CEO may also have personal compulsions and preferences, rewarding and selecting some managers over others who may be more capable, due to their long association and loyalty with the CEO in earlier roles. While there is a lot of talk of pure performance, the fact is that, beyond a point, it is not true.But it is just not chemistry and loyalty that take precedence over merit in appointments. Companies in different jurisdictions need to respect laws in terms of inclusion and diversity in recruitment and advancement based on considerations of race, gender, colour, caste, religion and nationality. So, leaders in companies can, at best, do constrained optimisation even to comply with the rule of the land they operate in. It is true some table stakes performance is always required of managers. But for real success, other factors often become important. The companies themselves, through their boards, give guidance on the need in their personnel policies to create balance. They may want to balance the preferences, and even biases, of a CEO’s personality and beliefs. This is not always a bad thing and may even be a time horizon thing. It often helps prepare a company for the long run even if it comes with some short-term cost. It’s important, therefore, to break away from simplistic notions of meritocracy. In fact, a growing body of research in psychology and neuroscience suggests that believing in meritocracy makes people more selfish, less self-critical and even more prone to acting in discriminatory ways. This makes “meritocracy” not only wrong, but bad.Let me, therefore, identify good and bad reasons for not being meritocratic in a company. Humans have many hidden biases. They often prefer people like themselves and find it easy to work with them. In certain contexts, and up to a certain size and geographic spread, this enhances efficiency. These companies know how to identify people who will succeed, and these people are a good fit for the company. They may be of limited ability in an objective sense, but are contextually suited. Being aware and getting a grip around the constraints will allow managers the ability to make better career choices in these companies. This is the good case for why meritocracies are not really meritocracies.One group of companies can be exempted from this need, and they are family-owned and managed businesses. The family may have created the business for its family members, and, if they are transparent about this, it is perfectly fair for family members to run these companies.The bad case for meritocracies not being meritocracies is to do with CEO insecurity — where the CEO prevents the building of a second line, where loyalty is rewarded over performance, where targets are poorly set and board inertia is used to preserve the status quo. Units far from the centre can get away with toxic organisational pathologies for longer. In such situations, people can succeed due to plain luck or being in the right place at the right time when the opportunity came about. In these situations, modern techniques of anonymous 360 degrees feedback, understanding the market context by the board, and being sharp in getting to know the next level and having succession discussions are helpful. It is also helpful to create internal expectations that CEOs don’t stay in position for more than eight to ten years. There should also be rotation in levels below the CEO.Business managers should, thus, all be alert to their context and take control of their own destiny and not leave it with the human resources departments of their company. Managers need to evaluate their true prospects, evaluate their chemistry with their manager, and be alert to the corridor gossip about senior people’s movement because things can change very fast, and with it, the entire context. Essentially, individual naivety is not a strength and lamenting about being a victim is not a success strategy. Individuals need to always assess their situation and context and then decide whether they have a good chance of advancement. Senior managers need to go beyond the company hype about being a meritocracy and find the firm where they are the right person, at the right time, with the right profile. That is when they fly.Janmejaya Sinha is chairman, BCG IndiaThe views expressed are personal
In May this year, the government announced important reforms in agricultural markets. These included deregulation of farm foods from the Essential Commodities Act (ECA). Farmers were also allowed to sell their produce outside government-regulated markets, or Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs). Another set of changes allowed farmers to enter contract farming. While the government claims that these reforms will help farmers in getting a better price for their products, farmers’ groups have been agitating against these changes. Why are farmers opposing policies which are designed to help them? There are three factors which could explain these protests.Farmers do not trust big capital, and for good reasonThe entire logic of abolishing the monopoly of APMCs is that they artificially depress prices for farmers; allowing corporate players will guarantee better returns to farmers, the argument goes. Whether or not this happens cannot be said today. But farmers have a good reason to be circumspect about claims of growing presence of corporates being unambiguously good for them. Agricultural input markets , such as seeds, pesticides etc. have seen a large-scale corporatisation in the past decade, but this has been accompanied by a sharp rise in prices of intermediate inputs in agriculture. Data from the ministry of agriculture shows that a rising cost of intermediate goods has been the biggest reason for stagnation and eventual decline in terms of trade for farmers. Given this experience, the suspicion towards growing footprint of big capital leading to a squeeze in earnings cannot be dismissed just as dogma. It is not very difficult to understand why this happens. Farmers are often hard-pressed for resources against traders and end up selling their output when prices are lower. Replacing local traders with big capital will only increase this gap in bargaining power.Farmers were never very anti-APMC to begin withThe claim that agricultural markets were completely shackled before these reforms is factually incorrect. A National Statistical Office (NSO) report based on a 2012-13 survey found that farmers have been selling large part of their produce to private traders outside APMCs even earlier. For 31 crops sold between July 2012 and June 2013, local private traders were the single biggest buyers in the case of 29 crops. Mandis, not all of which were under APMCs, were the biggest buyers in just two crops; arhar in the kharif season and gram in the rabi season. Except in soybean, the share of farmers selling their crops to mandis did not even exceed 25% for any crop. In fact, farmers want more rather than less government intervention. A Reserve Bank of Indiastudy based on a survey of farmers and traders in 2018 found that more than 50% farmers found Minimum Support Price for crops to be the most beneficial scheme for farmers. This number was just around one-fifth for e-NAM, a pan-India trading portal introduced by the Modi government. Even on the priority list of measures that may help in right cropping decisions/better price realisation and abolition of intermediaries (which is what doing away with monopoly of APMC would achieve) was ranked way below facilities such as reliable weather forecasts and storage facilities.The political economy of big-farmer protestsThere is merit in the criticism that the prevailing APMC model perpetuates some form of rent-seeking behaviour, both public and private, especially in the so-called green revolution areas. APMCs levy commission on the produce which is sold on their premises. This is a source of income for both governments and licensed traders. States such as Punjab and Haryana charge a higher commission than others. For example, the Shanta Kumar committee on restructuring the Food Corporation of India noted that Punjab and Haryana were charging a commission of 14.5% and 11.5% on wheat while this was just 3.6% in Rajasthan. This commission is a valuable source of revenue for these governments. The local elite, which have diversified interests in both farming and trading also benefit from the process. Any move to suddenly do away with these benefits, irrespective of its merits or demerits, is bound to trigger a political backlash.The resignation of Harsimrat Kaur Badal of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) from the union cabinet is a case in point. According to the CSDS-Lokniti National Election Study, in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the SAD-BJP alliance had a lead of 25 percentage points over the Congress among Jat-Sikhs in Punjab. The SAD-BJP had the biggest support among this community, which represents the landed elite in Punjab, and which has also been the traditional supporter of SAD’s politics. By 2019, this massive lead had turned into a four percentage point deficit vis-a-vis the Congress. Also, in the 2019 elections, the SAD-BJP alliance polled the most votes among Hindu upper castes, who are more of an urban demography in the state. With the Congress government in Punjab attacking these reforms, the SAD clearly fears losing its support among its traditional loyalists, the Jat Sikhs....
A week after Tripura high court asked the state government to file an affidavit answering certain Covid-19 related questions, the court asked the government to submit details on thirteen other queries related to the disease by September 28.The high court’s division bench comprising chief justice Akil Kureshi and justice Subhasish Talapatra took up the case suo motto after a series of allegations of poor health services for Covid-19 patients at Govind Ballabh Pant (GBP) hospital, a dedicated Covid hospital in the state, emerged.Last week, the high court asked the state to file an affidavit mentioning the total number of active Covid-19 cases, number of Covid care centres with their medical and paramedical staff, doctors and necessary infrastructure, fund allocation to upgrade government Covid care centres, if any private hospital has been given permission to admit Covid-19 patients. The court also asked for the government’s reply on alleged lack of communication between doctors and Covid-19 patients and their relatives.Also Read: Tripura to undertake mask enforcement drive across stateAfter reading state’s affidavit on Friday, the high court asked the government for further information related to the number of laboratory technicians in every district, number of patients and beds available at GBP hospital and Covid-19 patients admitted at other Covid care and health centres, amount of fine collected for violation of government order on wearing masks, social distancing, number of ventilators and ambulances equipped with oxygen for shifting Covid-19 patients, number of Covid tests conducted every day in the past seven days along with the positivity rate and the recovery rate. It also asked for the central team’s report and initiatives taken by the government to negotiate rates for treatment of Covid patients in private hospitals.Also Read: After journalist body issues ultimatum, Tripura CM says his speech was not to threatenThe court also gave suggestions to set up a special enquiry cell at GBP hospital to manage communication between Covid-19 patients and their relatives and also a complaints and suggestion center.Advocate Somik Deb was appointed as amicus curiae in the case. A total of 20,972 Covid cases have been recorded in the state so far including 235 patients who succumbed to the disease, as per the latest report. Two other Covid 19 patients died by suicide.
Updated: Sep 19, 2020 23:51 ISTMumbai Indians captain Rohit Sharma on Saturday said that the batsmen in his side did not carry on for long like Faf du Plessis and Ambati Rayudu for Cheannai Super Kings which made the difference in the match. While Faf remained unbeaten on 58 runs to take, Rayudu smashed 71 runs to help their side chase down the total of 163, despite losing two early wickets.Speaking after the loss at the post-match presentation ceremony, Rohit Sharma said: “None of our batsmen carried on for us, like du Plessis and Rayudu did for CSK. I think we were 85 in the first 10 overs. Credit to the CSK bowlers, they bowled well at the end to pull things back.IPL 2020 Full Coverage“Something for us to learn. Still early days.

Anyway, this is new normal, but I hope for a while and hope that things get better soon. We need to adapt to the pitches, it got better with the dew coming,” he said.“You need to hit the gaps and focus on that part of the game. The opposition can tie you down, it’s all about understanding what we need to do,” the MI captain added.Mumbai Indians will next face off against Kolkata Knight Riders on Wednesday.

Updated: Sep 18, 2020 20:42 ISTA Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) official was critically injured after he was shot by gold smugglers in Jodhpur on Friday morning, officials said.The federal agency recovered 5.5 kg gold worth Rs 2.75 crore from the car that the smugglers were travelling in and later 200 kg of unaccounted silver from the premises of a Jodhpur-based financier.In a statement issued on Friday evening, DRI said that “acting on specific intelligence, the officers of DRI Jodhpur intercepted a vehicle at Kharia Meethapur on the Jaipur-Jodhpur highway (near Balari), suspected to be carrying smuggled gold of foreign origin, in the early hours of September 18”.On being apprehended by the DRI team, one of the three occupants of the intercepted Innova SUV, opened fire without any provocation in which one of the team members was critically injured and had to be rushed to the hospital, the agency said.“The rummaging of the intercepted vehicle led to the recovery of about 5.5 kgs of smuggled foreign-origin gold having market value of approximately Rs 2.75 crore. The smuggled gold was found concealed in a specially made cavity under the passengers’ seats and was being transported from Jaipur to Jodhpur,” the DRI said.The agency added that “In the follow up search at the residence of the Jodhpur-based key financer of the smuggled gold, around 200 kg of unaccounted for silver bars were also recovered”.The agency refused to share further details.
Hitachi said Wednesday it is pulling out of a multi-billion-pound nuclear power plant project in Wales, citing a worsening investment environment, in a blow to Britain’s low-carbon energy ambitions.The project in Anglesey had already been suspended for 20 months “and the investment environment has become increasingly severe due to the impact of Covid-19”, the Japanese firm said in a statement.The company said it would coordinate with the UK government and others on the fate of its licences and planned sites given the withdrawal decision.The Japanese industrial giant’s plans to build two reactors at the Wylfa Newydd site in Wales had been on hold since January 2019 because of financing concerns.The cost of building the plant on Anglesey, off northwest Wales, had been estimated at up to £20 billion ($25.7 billion, 21.7 billion euros).Its targeted production capacity was nearly three gigawatts -- enough to supply around six percent of Britain’s electricity needs.As recently as last month, Hitachi’s Horizon Nuclear subsidiary had insisted it was still committed to the project but news of the planned withdrawal emerged in the Japanese media this week, prompting dismay in Anglesey.“If this decision is confirmed then it will be a devastating blow to the Anglesey economy,” council leader Llinos Medi said in a statement on Tuesday.Hitachi had been waiting for the British government’s latest energy strategy, which is still unpublished but could potentially include new financing models for the nuclear industry.Britain’s nuclear power plants built in the last century have either closed or are coming to the end of their lifespan.But the country wants to maintain the 20 percent of electricity it gets from the nuclear sector, to help meet its pledge to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2050 and tackle climate change.The Hinkley Point scheme, in western England, is currently the only nuclear project under construction and is due to be completed in 2025.Hitachi’s decision comes against a backdrop of concern at Chinese involvement in Britain’s nuclear industry, and strained diplomatic ties between London and Beijing.Lawmakers have been asking questions about China General Nuclear Power’s (CGN) involvement in several projects, including one in partnership with France’s EDF.The move also puts another dent in Japanese attempts to expand its nuclear businesses overseas after the Fukushima catastrophe effectively halted demand for new reactors in Japan.In 2018, Toshiba also pulled the plug on a nuclear power plant in northwest England.
Last week, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh called the renowned naturalist and broadcaster Sir David Attenborough “the voice of nature” while presenting him the Indira Gandhi Award for Peace, Disarmament and Development. The popularity and influence of Attenborough’s television series, films and books on the natural world, ranging from the life of insects to the life of mammals, from the life of birds to life under the sea, would in my view entitle him to be called Nature’s vishwaguru. It was a pity that the award had to be presented to Attenborough virtually, but his passionate conviction was not diminished by having to give his acceptance speech to camera, rather than before an audience — his broadcasting skills saw to that.Attenborough’s message for India and the world was stark. “Humans have overrun the planet,” he warned and pointed out that there are now three times as many people on earth as when he was born 93 years ago. The consequences for the natural world have been, he said, “devastating”. He listed some of those consequences. “Half the tropical forests have been felled, half the coral reefs, one of the richest environments in the sea and the nursery for oceanic fish, are dead. We have scoured the seas with such technical skills and ingenuity that we have annihilated entire fish populations.”On land, Attenborough said that we had left little or no room for other mammals. Apparently 96% of the global mammal population now consists of humans and the animals we breed to feed ourselves, leaving just four per cent for every other species.The terrifying consequence of all this, according to Attenborough, is that we are putting at risk the natural processes on which we depend for our very lives. So what should be done to avert this risk? Attenborough said, “We must change our ways and do so swiftly.”However, he warned, “Success will only come if the nations of the world agree to act together and help one another. This will not be easy. We have to change to becoming internationalists, which will involve giving and taking.”But the leader of the world’s richest and most powerful nation, President Donald Trump, is pulling the United States (US) out of the Paris agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions because he maintains “it will undermine America’s economy and put America at a permanent disadvantage”.Attenborough said it was up to us, the voters, to make it clear that we want politicians to act to avoid the major crisis he fears we are heading for, a crisis he said “which is not national, not international, but global and which the nations of the world must face together”. It is up to us, according to Attenborough, because politicians will only accept the need to give as well as take if they have the support of those who put them in power.The world’s voice of nature delivered a message relevant to India’s past, present and future. In the past, India contributed more than its fair share to the world being overrun by humans because of the failures of the family planning programme. At present, India has 15 out of 20 of the world’s most polluted cities and came below all other South Asian countries except Afghanistan in the latest Biennial Environment Performance Index published by Yale University. In the future, India is threatened by spreading deserts, rising sea levels and floods caused by deforestation and melting Himalayan glaciers.But India cannot prevent these dangers on its own. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has acknowledged that. He told last year’s United Nations Climate Action Summit, “The world needs to act now.”Attenborough says it’s up to the Indian voters to ensure that the current government and future governments are internationalist in their outlook when it comes to saving the planet.The views expressed are personal
At one level, the controversy around Facebook in India — sparked by a Wall Street Journal (WSJ) report about how a top Facebook executive allegedly turned a blind eye to the hate speech of a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator to keep the government happy — is about a private firm, its functioning, and whether decision-making is based on due process, personal prejudices or political imperatives.But at another level, the controversy is much deeper. It is about the role of technology in general but select social media companies in particular, the transmission of information flows in India, the future of the media, and the nature of Indian democracy. This newspaper has consistently argued that unless firms such as Facebook are treated as media companies, held accountable, and forced to meet the same ethical, commercial, legal and regulatory obligations as media companies, the democratic project runs the risk of being severely, perhaps even irreversibly compromised. The current controversy makes this task even more urgent.But, unfortunately, the debate in India on the issue is focusing on the wrong question. Here is what has happened so far.The WSJ report — and subsequent follow- up stories which suggested that both senior executives of Facebook and WhatsApp (which is owned by Facebook) have had close ties with the BJP — has led to a debate on the political orientation of the company in India. The Congress has written two letters to Mark Zuckerberg on how top officials of the company are partisan, demanding a high-level probe into Facebook India’s leadership team and that a new team be constituted till the investigation is complete. The Trinamool Congress has written to the company, alleging bias during the 2014 and 2019 elections and accusing it of a partisan attitude against the party in the run-up to the West Bengal elections next year.The government, on its part, in a letter sent by law and information technology minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, has accused Facebook of a diametrically opposite charge — of being dominated by those who broadly belong to one political persuasion (read liberals and Left), censoring of right-of-centre views, and of selecting biased third-party fact checkers. It must take something for an entity to be in a position where it is criticised by all sides in India’s deeply-polarised and divided polity. But while the question of the political motivations of Facebook’s staff is important, and must be investigated, the problem is much deeper.To be sure, Facebook — besides enabling a sense of community of friends and family for those who use it for personal purposes — has played a key role in democratising everyday discourse; it has created an opportunity for many who may not have been able to get their voices heard to articulate positions on key issues; and it is symbolic of the broader citizen engagement with social media.But here is the problem. Facebook does all of this by pretending to be a mere intermediary and platform. This is an outright lie. The company exercises discretion in what content it allows and what content it blocks (often inefficiently, with obvious blinders). Its content strategy is based on virality where posts which may be untrue or spread hate, are allowed because of the audience engagement they will draw. This then aids its commercial model, which is based on accessing the most private information about users, and providing a receptive, customised audience to advertisers — including political advertisers — often without full disclosure. Facebook — based on the fact that it has both a captive user base, often in dark about how their information is being channelled and used, and potential advertisers looking to tap this user base — aggregates content, which other established media platforms produce at great cost, and monopolises revenues.So here is the broad approach that governs Facebook’s functioning. Use content produced by someone else under the garb of being an intermediary while making money off it. Allow hate speech and fake news under the garb of free speech while selectively making editorial interventions based on political and commercial motivations. Monetise private information of users, without them even knowing it fully, to draw advertisers. Keep the State happy by catering to the political interests of those who are in key positions, in return for possible regulatory clearances for other businesses. Destroy the economics of traditional media while using its content. And do all this by playing on legal ambiguity in different jurisdictions, as documented in an excellent story on the legal architecture, or rather legal anarchy, in this realm, by Binayak Dasgupta in this paper on Friday.It is this ruthless, predatory approach that is the core problem with Facebook. To deal with these various breaches of law, if not in letter then in spirit, what is needed is a strong decision which redefines the broad structure within which companies such as Facebook operate. The first step in this is to treat Facebook (and others such as Google) as media companies, not platforms and not intermediaries. This, in one stroke, will bring them on the same page as other media companies, and they will have to be accountable for the content. So just as a mainstream paper editor and reporter has to answer questions in court if there is an instance of hate speech in that particular newspaper, Facebook will have to answer questions for the disturbing content it often hosts.Or just as media companies have to engage in fair and mutually acceptable commercial arrangements when they use content from elsewhere, Facebook will have to do so too. An ongoing debate in Australia is centred on precisely this question — where the government has said Facebook must share revenues based on content with media organisations concerned and Facebook is now threatening to block news content rather than share fair revenue.Or just as a media company has to maintain a State-Church divide between its editorial and business ends, and disclose when there is commercially-sponsored content — even if in practice, this is breached at times by some institutions — Facebook will have to do so. This will help users discern propaganda, in a far clearer manner than what exists at the moment.It is only when there is a regulatory redesign that the question of political bias can be addressed. The fact that Facebook has been allowed to operate in what is almost a vacuum means the company’s core priority is keeping the political dispensation happy so that it can sustain its user base, ad revenues, and predatory approach to content. What can change this is creating an accountability structure to change the rules of the game.And if this is not done, be prepared for a further degeneration of public discourse, possible violence and lynchings based on hate speech and fake news, the dismantling of the traditional media ecosystem which informs citizens with rigour and independence, and the creation of a corporate behemoth which may become so powerful that it will be difficult to regulate at all. India’s politicians are right to attack Facebook, but they need to now do it for the right reasons.letters@hindustantimes.com
Under the National Education Policy (NEP), a new National Curriculum Framework for Teacher Education (NCFTE) will be formulated in the country, said Union Minister for Education, Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank on Wednesday.The new and comprehensive NCFTE will be formulated by the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) in consultation with the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), according to the Ministry of Education.Earlier, Nishank had said that the government is taking multiple initiatives and actions for implementation of National Education Policy (NEP) 2020.“The NEP 2020 has been finalised after a detailed consultation process with all stakeholders including State/UT Governments. As per National Education Policy 2020, implementation of the Policy requires multiple initiatives and actions, which will have to be taken by multiple bodies in a synchronized and systematic manner,” Pokhriyal said in a written reply in the Lok Sabha today.“Accordingly, this Ministry has communicated to all States/UT Governments for implementation of NEP 2020 in letter and spirit. Ministry of Education is also organising ‘ShikshakParv’ from September 8 to September 25, 2020, to deliberate on various themes and implementation of NEP 2020 aimed at eliciting suggestions,” he said.The major reforms in school education brought by NEP 2020 include universalisation of Early Childhood Care Education (ECCE), national mission to focus on basic literacy and basic numeracy, no rigid separation between arts and sciences streams and removal of separation between vocational and academic and curricular and extra-curricular.
Superb centuries from Alex Carey and Glenn Maxwell inspired Australia to a dramatic three-wicket victory over England on Wednesday as the touring side clinched the one-day international series 2-1. The pair put on 212 runs for the sixth wicket after Australia had slumped to 73-5 chasing a stiff target of 303 runs in the final game of the series.Jonny Bairstow scored 112 as England recovered from losing their first two wickets to the opening two balls of the game to score 302 for seven in their 50 overs after winning the toss. Australia lost their first five wickets cheaply but fought back brilliantly to win with two balls to spare against the world champions and inflict their first home one-day series defeat for five years.Also Read | England vs Australia, 3rd ODI Highlights at Old Trafford in ManchesterEngland got off to the worst possible start as Jason Roy drove a thick outside edge to backward point and Joe Root was trapped lbw by Mitchell Starc off the first two balls of the innings. Bairstow set about engineering a recovery, however, and England quickly pushed the run rate above six an over.A 114-run partnership for the fifth wicket between Bairstow and Sam Billings (54) provided the backbone of the innings and Chris Woakes also contributed a rapid half century to take England past the 300-run mark. Woakes then took the first two wickets of the Australia innings before Root, with his part-time off spin, nicked out David Warner and Mitchell Marsh cheaply to remove the tourists’ top order.When Marnus Labuschagne was run out in the 17th over, Australia were reeling on 73/5. Carey and Maxwell fought back, however, dragging Australia right back into the match with lusty hitting and leaving them needing 21 runs off the last 18 balls for victory. They looked like throwing a winning position away when Maxwell top-edged spinner Adil Rashid and was caught by Tom Curran for 108 off 90 balls and 10 balls later Carey was caught by Mark Wood at third man off Jofra Archer for 106.Australia needed 10 runs off the final over which England captain Eoin Morgan bravely entrusted to Rashid. Starc smacked a six off his first ball and hit another boundary to win the game, bringing a crowded summer of international cricket to an exciting conclusion.England had a busy three-month window into which they crammed six tests and 12 limited-overs internationals – all played behind closed doors in a bio-secure bubble because of the Covid-19 pandemic.
In the first official statement in Parliament on the India-China standoff at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, defence minister Rajnath Singh laid out India’s case. He provided a quick backdrop of the border conflict, outlined the post-1988 template where the two sides agreed to maintain peace and tranquillity at the border and deepen bilateral relations without necessarily compromising their positions on the dispute itself, chronicled the series of violations of this broad understanding by China over the last five months, and described the current state of negotiations where the onus fundamentally rests on China to disengage.After months of political ambiguity over the exact situation at the border, Mr Singh’s speech came across as a sharp, comprehensive, and effective intervention from the highest levels in government. Three features of India’s position stand out. One, New Delhi is clear that China has amassed troops, it has not adhered to LAC, it has violated border pacts, it has been violent in its conduct, it has attempted transgressions, and it has attempted to change the status quo unilaterally. Two, India considers this unacceptable, it has conveyed its position to China unambiguously, and New Delhi will pursue dialogue and hope for a peaceful resolution of the issue. Three, while relying on talks, India will continue to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity.Mr Singh pointedly spoke of counter-deployments, friction points and face-offs, including moves at the end of August when India successfully resisted Chinese attempts and gained tactical advantage.There were gaps in the speech too, some of it understandable given the sensitive nature of the situation. Mr Singh refrained from asserting that China was currently in Indian territory — which has drawn criticism. But while more details would have been good, this is also a time when the government needs to be given the benefit of doubt because of the complex nature of the crisis. One way to, however, provide more information is to have a closed door briefing for leaders of other parties, which, as a report in this newspaper suggested on Wednesday, is under consideration. The defence minister did well. The government should now build a national consensus to deal with the challenge.
In a telling statement, Sri Lanka’s new foreign secretary Jayanath Colombage has said that Colombo will have an “India first” strategic policy outlook. Arguing that while the Rajapaksa government has adopted a posture of neutrality in its dealings with major regional and global powers, he was categorical in underlining that “the president [Gotabaya Rajapaksa] has stated that we have a strategic security-wise ‘India first’ policy because we cannot be, we should not be, we can’t afford to be a strategic security threat for India, period.” These are powerful words indeed, and along with Colombage’s acknowledgement that the decision to give Hambantota port on a 99- year lease to China was a “mistake”, it underscored the pitfalls of a rather infantile debate in this country about India’s neighbourhood policy in recent months.There has been a barrage of criticism that India is “losing” its neighbourhood as border tensions with Nepal have grown and China has continued to spread its tentacles in India’s vicinity.That Indian and Chinese forces are squaring off at the border has reinforced this plaintive cry that New Delhi is getting marginalised in the neighbourhood. Even foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla’s visit to Bangladesh, his first outside India since the Covid-19 lockdown, got mired in needless debates about rising Chinese clout in Dhaka.By all accounts, Shringla’s visit to Dhaka was a successful one and it managed to convey Bangladesh’s privileged position in Indian foreign policy matrix. Against the backdrop of the two nations celebrating “Mujib Borsho”, and the 50th year of the liberation of Bangladesh as well as the establishment of diplomatic relations next year, this visit was key to setting the tone for a busy calendar of events ahead and a number of high-level bilateral visits. From expediting and conceptualising major connectivity projects to diversifying bilateral engagement, the two nations are getting serious about their priorities.What is key here is the role played by top leadership in both nations. Both Narendra Modi and Sheikh Hasina, despite some domestic scepticism, understand the importance of cultivating strong bilateral relations. For Modi, the development of India’s East and Northeast is a top priority and a strategic imperative for New Delhi.And that region can only achieve its full potential if it’s better integrated with Bangladesh, thereby ensuring that India-Bangladesh connectivity projects will continue to be at the top of the agenda. It is important to recognise that this connectivity push is being shaped by a politician like Narendra Modi who has been forthright about the challenges posed by illegal immigration. The fact that by next year India and Bangladesh are likely to have nine rail links is an indicator of how fast priorities in New Delhi are evolving.There is also a growing desire on the part of the two nations to look beyond the Bengali-Bengali narrative and shape the engagement by bringing in new stakeholders more in sync with 21st century realities. There is a sizeable Tamil and Telugu population in Bangladesh in the textile industry and tech space, and a growing number of Bangladeshi students and medical tourists are now visiting South India, thereby changing the very complexion of this engagement.It is, therefore, quite curious to suggest that India might be losing ground in Bangladesh. Of course, the all-pervasive China factor has to be reckoned with. In most of India’s neighbours, China has a seeming advantage that, unlike India, it is not part of the domestic political calculus. But, unlike India, it also does not have a long-term stake in the South Asian region.It can afford to ignore the region, which it does, when its interests are not served. New Delhi doesn’t have that luxury. For good or bad, India’s future and that of its neighbours remain intertwined. So while China’s financial commitments to various countries in the region are much talked about, given their size, they are largely declaratory. Even in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, China’s actual spending has been quite limited, compared to the $62 billion amount which is often advertised. India’s declared loan commitments might be small, but when it comes to actual delivery, India is not far behind. Its loan terms and payment conditionalities are much better too.For all the hue and cry about India “losing” the neighbourhood, the ground reality is quite different. With Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and the Maldives, New Delhi’s relations are robust and progressing well. Bhutan remains as close as ever and even in the case of Nepal, it was Prime Minister KP Oli who recently reached out to his Indian counterpart.Afghanistan is passing through a difficult phase, but both the Afghan government and the Taliban leadership recognise India’s critical role in shaping their nation’s future trajectory. And all this has happened when India has been able to successfully marginalise Pakistan, regionally and globally.To view India’s neighbourhood policy through the lens of “wins” and “losses” is to miss the structural imperatives that shape the outcome. A region shaped by two major powers will never have a linear trajectory. And such a narrative also does a great disservice to smaller nations in the region, which have their own agency in shaping their engagements with these powers. Finally, there has never been a golden period of foreign policy when New Delhi’s ties with its neighbours were seamless. Going by India’s historical record, Delhi’s regional outreach today is quite promising. Indian discourse today seems more driven by domestic political imperatives than by the empirical realities on the ground.Harsh V Pant is professor, King’s College London and director of research, Observer Research Foundation, New DelhiThe views expressed are personal

* U.S. Fed’s policy announcement on Wednesday* Spot gold may test resistance at $1,975/oz- technicals* Platinum hits near one-monthGold hit a near two-week high on Tuesday as the dollar weakened and investors turned their focus to a U.S. Federal Reserve monetary policy meeting, seeking details of how it planned to hold down rates while aiming to boost inflation.Spot gold was up 0.5% at $1,966.47 per ounce by 0512 GMT, after hitting $1,967.46 earlier, its highest level since Sept. 2. U.S. gold futures climbed 0.7% to $1,976.90.“Gold looks firm mainly because of a weaker dollar and also U.S. Treasury yields are coming down a bit,” said Edward Meir, an analyst at ED&F Man Capital Markets.The dollar index slipped against its rivals, making gold less expensive for holders of other currencies.Market participants now await the U.S. Fed’s two-day policy event which ends on Wednesday, its first such meeting since Chairman Jerome Powell unveiled a policy shift towards greater tolerance of inflation, effectively pledging to keep interest rates low for longer.“After the Jackson Hole symposium, the market is asking for a bit more colour around by what means the Fed plans to stoke inflation,” said IG Markets analyst Kyle Rodda.“...it’s also asking for some indication that the Fed will continue to suppress risk-free rates, if inflation does begin to seriously emerge.”Gold, which has risen nearly 30% this year so far, is seen as a hedge against inflation. Lower interest rates decrease the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Jerome Powell will testify before the Senate Banking Committee on coronavirus relief, the committee said on Monday.Spot gold may test resistance at $1,975 per ounce, a break above could lead to a gain into $1,984-$1,996 range, Said Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao.Elsewhere, platinum rose 0.6% to $960.21 per ounce after hitting its highest since Aug. 18 at $966.Silver gained 1% to $27.44 and palladium eased 0.1% to $2,311.78.
A senior European Union official headed to London Thursday for an emergency meeting with UK officials over Britain’s plan to break part of the Brexit divorce agreement.Britain’s decision to break international law by overwriting part of the EU Withdrawal Agreement has alarmed European leaders and threatens to scuttle already-fragile UK-EU negotiations on trade and future relations.European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic was due to meet Michael Gove, Britain’s Brexit preparation minister, in a hastily arranged meeting. The two men head a joint committee charged with sorting out post-Brexit rules for Northern Ireland, the only part of the UK to share a border with an EU member, Ireland.Keeping that border free of customs posts and other obstacles is a key aim of the Withdrawal Agreement signed by the two sides less than a year ago. An open border underpins the peace agreement that ended decades of violence in Northern Ireland.Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservative British government announced this week that it plans to legislate to give itself the power to deviate from some of the provisions in the agreement about Northern Ireland trade.The announcement brought stern warnings from the EU.“The withdrawal agreement is not open for renegotiation and we expect that the letter and the spirit of the withdrawal agreement will be fully respected,” Sefcovic said.Many British politicians and lawyers also expressed alarm, saying that reneging on a legally binding international commitment would trash Britain’s reputation for upholding law and order.“If we can’t be trusted to abide by our word on this matter, well then why would anyone trust us in the future?” said Edward Garnier, a former British solicitor-general.Britain left the political structures of the EU on Jan. 31 and will make an economic break when an 11-month transition period ends on Dec. 31. The two sides are trying to strike a new trade deal by then, but talks have bogged down over issues including fishing rights in UK waters and fair-competition rules for businesses.The two sides’ chief negotiators, David Frost and Michel Barnier, are due to end their latest round of negotiations on Thursday. Both sides say that unless there is an agreement by October, Britain is facing an economically disruptive no-deal exit on Jan. 1.
Chennai Super Kings batsman Ruturaj Gaikwad, who tested positive for Covid-19 last month, remains in isolation and is unlikely to be available for the team’s IPL opener against Mumbai Indians on September 19 in Abu Dhabi.CSK CEO Kasi Viswanathan said the India A batsman is doing “absolutely fine” but has not yet got the BCCI’s clearance to join the team’s bio-bubble.“Ruturaj has still not been cleared by the BCCI medical team and is in isolation. He is unlikely to be available for the first match. We are expecting him back in the (bubble) in the next couple of days and he is doing absolutely fine,” Viswanathan told PTI.Also Read | Losing T20 WC final to India will hurt till my last breath: Pak openerThirteen members of the CSK contingent tested positive for the virus last month and two of them were players - Gaikwad and Deepak Chahar. Chahar, along with 11 others, has recovered and resumed training after clearing his mandatory two tests.Gaikwad too underwent two tests on Sunday and Monday, the results of which are not known. After clearing the Covid test after the 14-day quarantine, a player is also needed to undergo a cardiovascular and lung function test to ensure he is fit to train.Gaikwad is seen as Raina’s replacement in the team after the latter pulled out of the tournament and flew back home due to personal reasons. Senior spinner Harbhajan Singh has also withdrawn due to personal reasons.Visawanthan said the team has not not decided on their replacements yet.
Former Shiromani Akali Dal MLA Manjinder Singh Sirsa, who recently revived his complaint against filmmaker Karan Johar and leading Bollywood celebs for alleged drug use in a party, has now alleged that Mumbai Police may be “hand-in-glove” with those who indulge in drug abuse in the film industry.Speaking with a news channel, the political leader said, “I had urged the then Mumbai Police Commissioner to probe into the ‘rave party’ last year in August. There can be only two reasons for the probe to not happen at all till date- either they believe the drugs use was so normal that no investigation is required, or they are all hand-in-glove. Wo sab ek dusra se mile hue hain. “He further told Republic, “Why else would you not probe into a matter despite video proof and several reminders? This is why I decided to meet NCB chief Rakesh Asthana and urge him to investigate. Shouldn’t have Mumbai Police investigated this instead of looking the other way?”Sirsa posted a video of his interaction and tweeted, “Soon @karanjohar will have “Koffee with NCB “ where the deepest and darkest secrets of “Koke with Karan” will be uncovered @KanganaTeam @shahidkapoor.”Sirsa had filed a complaint with the Narcotics Control Bureau, asking the agency to investigate what he has alleged was a ‘drug party’ video from last year. Sharing his letter to NCB chief Asthana, Sirsa said that he met with him and asked him to launch an investigation into the video. “I met Sh. Rakesh Asthana, Chief of @narcoticsbureauat BSF head quarter, Delhi regarding submission of complaint for investigation & action against film Producer @karanjohar & others for organizing drug party at his residence in Mumbai That party video must be investigated into!” he wrote.I met Sh.

I took that video with all the earnestness... would I be putting out that video if there was anything happening at all, I am not stupid.”#UDTABollywood - Fiction Vs RealityWatch how the high and mighty of Bollywood proudly flaunt their drugged state!!I raise my voice against #DrugAbuse by these stars.

With every Unlock announcement, the cinema exhibition sector waits with bated breath to get a green light for operations, but even after four such phases, the doors of cinemas are still shut. And while the Multiplex Association of India (MAI) and various other theatre bodies have been constantly making rounds of the various ministries with detailed SOPs, they have only been met with disappointment so far.Many Bollywood celebrities including the likes of Abhishek Bachchan, Boney Kapoor, Richa Chadha, Anurag Kashyap, Manoj Bajpayee, Suniel Shetty,Anubhav Sinha have taken to social media to extend their support to the industry as well as make an appeal to the government to #SaveCinemasSaveJobs.Can’t wait.

Best place on Earth! https://t.co/4CionM5Aqu — Abhishek Bachchan (@juniorbachchan) September 4, 2020“There is zero income for six months and the expenses are mounting. Every filmmaker and actor needs to speak out now because this is the industry that has made all of them who they are. This is the least they owe to the people who are employed by the industry. They are now getting the fat pay check from the OTT platforms because of what they have achieved numbers at the box office in the past. We have actors who are speaking about migrant labours, student, etc but their own house is burning and virtually most of them have turned a blind eye. A few of them have spoken out but for the survival of this whole ecosystem the entire industry needs to stand together,” shares film exhibitor Akshaye Rathi.#SaveCinemasSaveJobs and save lives!

I think the focus has to be keep this momentum going and see how the word reaches the decision makers.”Filmmaker Milap Zaveri too has taken to social media to express his disappointment over the lack of support to the cinemas. Talking about how Hollywood star Tom Cruise recently shared a video of his movie going experience in London, Zaveri feels it is time for big stars of Bollywood to weigh in their support to the sector.Dreams come to life at movies on the big screen.

I really wonder why they have kept quiet for so long. They are stars today because of the theatres, OTT is a very recent phenomenon. I want to make films for the cinemas not OTTs and I want Satyameva Jayate to release in a theatre,” he shares.Outlining the significance of the “theatre experience”, Vinod Bhanushali, President of Marketing, Media & Publishing (TV), Music Acquisition of T-Series and co- Producer of T Series Films, says, “When you talk about Bollywood stars and big producers, theatres have been in our system for so many years in India. We have a habit of going to theatres, it’s like a celebration for people. Be it in small towns or big cities as people like watching films with their family. When you go to theatres and watch a comedy sequence with a crowd, you really enjoy that feeling. The big stars and producers are surely missing this part of having their films released on the big screen. They have to definitely explain this to the government but we have to keep in mind the current Covid conditon with amount of cases increasing, it needs to be taken into consideration.”Trade analyst Atul Mohan feels that stars do have a pull and influence and their word will hold a lot of weightage to the concerned bodies in the government.“In the past also we have seen how when the film industry and by that I mean the actors and filmmakers unites and makes an appeal to the government, it has worked, so why not now,” he asks.
The railways ministry has said that 97 people died while travelling on the Shramik special trains that were operated to repatriate domestic migrant workers, the first official confirmation of a string of fatalities that prompted questions over how the lockdown for Covid-19 was planned and on the measures made to help vulnerable, urban workers who were left without pay and jobs return to their homes in the Indian hinterland.The disclosure was made on Friday as a response to a question by Trinamool Congress MP Derek O’Brien in the Rajya Sabha. At the start of the monsoon session, a separate government department – the labour ministry – said it did not have data on how many migrant workers had died when the country locked down to stem the spread of Covid-19.“Out of these 97 cases of death, state police sent dead bodies for post mortem in 87 cases. 51 post-mortem reports have been obtained from respective state police so far, in which the reasons for deaths have been shown as cardiac arrest/heart disease/brain hemorrhage/pre-existing chronic disease/chronic lung disease/chronic liver disease etc,” said the reply by Union railways minister Piyush Goyal.The data accounted for deaths till September 9.On May 30, Hindustan Times first reported that between May 9 and 27, almost 80 deaths took place on board Shramik special trains, according to data accessed from the Railway Protection Force.Shramik special trains began operation on May 1 to ferry migrant labourers back home after hundreds were seen setting out on foot for their towns and villages hundreds of kilometres away in the middle of peak summer conditions. In all, 4,621 Shramik special trains were run between May 1 and August 31, 2020, carrying 6.3 million passengers to their home states, the ministry said in Parliament.In an interview to HT on June 1, after the report on the deaths, Goyal said that the Indian Railways has been transparent about the deaths, and insisted on compiling a list of them, and finding out causes even as news reports suggested that “eight or nine migrants” died on trains. The real number has emerged only because of this, he suggested. “We are very concerned... My heart goes out to the families (of those who have died),” the minister said.Separately on Saturday, the labour minister said the government is collecting information on suicide of migrant workers from states.
From mass whistling at the entry of their favourite hero, enjoying popcorn to interval chitchat — the fun-filled larger than life cinema experience seems to be a distant dream with theatres being shut for over six months now owing to the pandemic and subsequent lockdown. Much like the public, Bollywood celebs, too, are waiting and hoping that the theatres will soon reopen. We get talking to some of them about what is it that they’re missing the most about the movie viewing experience on the big screen.Tisca ChopraFor me, watching on the giant screen with that kind of sound makes the experience real. The idea of community watching is a part of our tradition. Our emotions become bigger when we laugh, sob, cry and clap together in excitement. Such experiences bring out the best in us. I hope theatres open soon. I think we are social to the point that the current state of affairs is unnatural for us. There are certain films, such as, Christopher Nolan’s latest movie Tenet, that I wanted to watch on the big screen.Arjun MathurWatching 3D films or for that matter any special effect extravaganza is what I can’t wait to experience again on the big screen. Theatres are kind of a community experience, it’s like a modern day equivalent to story being told and enjoyed together. There is a charm to watching stories being unfold on the big screen. The visuals take you to another world, sometimes you feel you are a part of what you see. I miss ganging up with friends for a cinema experience. And, if I am a part of a film that I am watching with everyone else then that’s a different high altogether.Manav KaulManav KaulI miss watching the early morning shows while sipping on my coffee and enjoying my samosa. I feel a tickle in my stomach every time a film is about to begin. Great filmmakers and cinematographers create experiences thinking about the big screen where you don’t miss out even on the minutest of details. People laughing, clapping together… even watching those song and dance sequences, fight scenes, all these on the big screen is a different experience altogether. And it becomes all the more special if I am a part of the film. Also, I’ miss watching 3D and animation movies in theaters.Kirti KulhariAs an actor, there’s not a bigger feeling than seeing yourself on the big screen and experiencing that yourself and with people around. I honestly believe no matter what replaces what, the pleasure of watching something on the big screen is unmatchable. That’s probably the reason why I wanted to become an actor. For me, watching something in the theatres is a very immersive experience. For that two to two-and-half hours, the outside world doesn’t exist. You can’t recreate that anywhere. I’m not just an actor but also a student of cinema who enjoys watching movies from all over the world. I get transported to that world of the story I am watching, which doesn’t happen on smaller screens. I can’t wait to enjoy this world of cinema that I’m not just a part of, but also a fan of.Zareen KhanI definitely miss the big screen experience even though the web has been an absolute blessing in this period and has been providing us with entertainment. But for me, watching films while munching on popcorns and enjoying the company of my friends will always be unmatched. There are a few movies which have a larger than life canvas and it cannot give you the same experience or visual treat if watched in smaller screen. The whole experience of watching a narrative in that dark room with many other people, sharing laughter, claps and sorrows as the narrative unfolds on screen is something that can never happen anywhere else.Amruta SubhashI miss watching a film with popcorn in hand and friends by your side. When you go to a theatre full of people, you become a part of their collective reaction to the emotions that’s being played out in the narrative. We all become one beyond our names, culture, beliefs and are unified by the larger than life experience and emotion that the story evokes within us. In our busy lives, even though we are with our families and friends, somewhere there’s this loneliness within. That sort of diminishes when we all cry and laugh together while watching a film in a theatre with many other people. This community watching culture and live reaction is unmatchable.Freddy DaruwalaIt’s something we all have grown up with. I feel when you go for a film you watch it in one go unlike now when we are watching on TV or phones, when we at times end up shutting or pausing in between. That submersive experience in a dark room with a 70 mm screen is totally larger than life. As you watch a Baahubali or Salman Khan hit a punch or Shah Rukh Khan’s signature pose and smile, the whistles, laughter and the collective response is a phenomenal experience altogether. For generations, going to a cinema on a Sunday or a holiday with family and friends is like a ritual.Author tweets @Shreya_MJ
Acceleration, says Chris Donaldson, is a potential game-changer in cricket. And just so you don’t start thinking this is an Olympic sprinter moving the conversation to his area of strength, the new Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) strength and conditioning coach offers an explanation.Also Read | Can be a finisher and bowl 4 overs: Gautam Gambhir names player who adds ‘balance’ to RCB squad in IPL 2020“From fielding, diving to chasing the ball to the boundary, doing that run out, all these things contribute a major part to the game. You can make quite a difference in the first two metres of how you accelerate. It is something we work hard on,” says the 45-year-old New Zealander from KKR’s base in Abu Dhabi.Also Follow | IPL 2020 Full CoverageDonaldson hopes his domain expertise will also improve KKR’s running between the wickets and bowlers’ run-ups, particularly important for the Kolkata team given their deep fast-bowling strength.“It’s not trying to change everything because people here are very good at what they do. (But) Track and field deals with all sorts of movement patterns, the fundamentals of the way people move and jump. I will hopefully be able to use some of the skills I have learnt and developed and help people deal with their running issues. (For bowlers) I might be able to help from the movement point of view, make the run-up more efficient or look at the bio-mechanics of the way they are landing,” he says.Also Read | Maxwell, Carey star with centuries as Australia win thriller to capture seriesHaving worked at High Performance Sport New Zealand, an institute heavy on sports science and technology, before moving to New Zealand Cricket, there is more to Donaldson than running.“He has a great set of exercises,” says young fast bowler Shivam Mavi. “One look and he can tell you that this area is strong and that needs to be worked on,” says Kamlesh Nagarkoti who, like Mavi, has had long spells of absence due to injuries.An IPL franchise hiring an Olympic athlete is a first, but KKR have made left-field appointments in the past. Rudi Webster, eminent sports psychologist and former first-class cricketer, was hired as mental skills coach in 2012 when KKR got their maiden title. Mike Horn, the South Africa-born Swiss adventurer, has been intermittently with the team since 2014, when KKR won again. After Brendon McCullum was named head coach, he dialled Donaldson, with whom he had worked as New Zealand captain en route to finishing runners-up in the 2015 World Cup.“He (McCullum) asked if I would be interested. You don’t miss that type of an opportunity and I know how lucky I am to be here,” says Donaldson.Then Covid-19 happened and Donaldson had to “think outside the square.” Cue, team bonding on Zoom calls through “bedroom workout routines” which gave “the boys’ sessions that they could create and do in their hotel rooms or at home.”“The sessions were designed to push them so that when we came out of lockdown, hopefully, we didn’t need to play too much catch up. Also, it gave them something to do each day,” says Donaldson.“There have been some unbelievable workouts. They are hard, and if you haven’t worked out for a while, you can’t do it. Sore bodies for a couple of days. But it’s amazing and very, very helpful for all the boys in this time of staying indoors,” KKR mentor Abhishek Nayar was quoted as saying in kkr.in about Donaldson’s regimen.Building on that base, Donaldson says that the players were made to go “pretty hard at the end of lockdown.” Arriving in UAE, “we loaded them a lot trying to make them cricket-hard and physically hard so that we can taper off leading into the tournament…. Sometimes, I have to hold them back because they try to do too much.”KKR open against defending champions Mumbai Indians in Abu Dhabi on September 23. Donaldson says it’s “amazing” that there will be no flying with matches in Abu Dhabi, Sharjah and Dubai. “It will definitely help with recovery and stop tiredness creeping in.”The son of famous filmmaker Roger Donaldson, the KKR coach says he had no stories to share of life in Los Angeles simply because he had a regular upbringing in New Zealand. “I would get the opportunity to experience something different when I would go there. It was always a lot of fun but it certainly didn’t lead to Hollywood parties.”Roger’s films include the Tom Cruise-starrer ‘Cocktail’, ‘No Way Out’ and ‘Thirteen Days’ with Kevin Costner and Dante’s Peak with Pierce Brosnan. His first feature, ‘Sleeping Dogs’ had Sam Neill. He got a Golden Palm nomination at Cannes in 1984 for ‘The Bounty’ (starring Anthony Hopkins and Mel Gibson).His son’s tryst with fame came through athletics and one of his feats has aged well. Along with Dallas Roberts, David Falealili and James Dolphin, Donaldson created a New Zealand national record in the 4x100 relay; their time of 38.99 set in November 2005 still stands. Donaldson also took part in the 1996 and 2000 Olympics, the 1998 and 2006 Commonwealth Games. He finished seventh in the 100m and 200m in 1998.“Those races were the highlight for me. (Ato Boldon won the 100m). And the world championships in Greece (1997) where I made the semi-finals in 200m running alongside the people you idolised and saw on TV,” he says.
It is often called the ‘El Clasico’ of IPL due to its significance. The Mumbai Indians and Chennai Super Kings rivalry on the field often ignites debates amongst its supporters. MI and CSK are the most successful franchises in IPL history with 4 and 3 titles respectively. MI vs CSK is often the game that is played on the final day of the season and players have taken part in several games between each teams in IPL history.Last year, Mumbai and Chennai met in the final with the Rohit Sharma-led team coming out on top in the final over of the match. Then the game was decided by a single run with Lasith Malinga defending nine runs that were needed by CSK to win IPL 2019.Both teams bring out the best in them and have often been part of several close encounters. They will be taking on each other in the opening match of the Indian Premier League 2020. Before the start of the match, let’s take a look at four players who are pivotal performers for their teams in this rivalry.READ| What does it take to succeed in the IPL?1. The MI captain Rohit Sharma is the leading run-scorer for his team against CSK with 705 runs in 27 matches. He has the chance to become the most successful batsman against CSK if he scores 43 runs or more in the match. Virat Kohli currently has 747 runs.2. MS Dhoni is also one player who loves to perform against MI. He has managed to amass 663 runs for his team. The leading run-scorer in this rivalry is however Suresh Raina, who has 704 runs against MI. He will not be playing as he has opted out due to personal reasons.3. When it comes to bowlers, Lasith Malinga is the most prolific with 31 wickets. But he has also opted out this season due to personal reasons. In his absence, Kieron Pollard could take up the mantle as he has 12 CSK wickets. Pollard is also in-form after leading the Trinbago Knight Riders to the CPL title and took four wickets in the final. He also has 279 runs against MI.4. For CSK, Dwayne Bravo has always troubled Mumbai Indians with his bowling. Bravo with 25 wickets is CSK’s leading wicket-taker against MI. He will again look to strike in season-opener on Saturday.
Heavy and widespread rain in peninsular and northeast India will persist till October, India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Saturday. Northwest India will continue to remain dry and Rajasthan is likely to experience dry weather but weather models are not showing monsoon withdrawal commencement from northwest India as yet.Due to heavy rain over south India and parts of northeast India rain deficiency of 30% in the week ending September 9 was not only compensated last week but also recorded an excess of 7% this week according to the weekly weather report. “A change in weather patterns which resulted in above normal rain in the past week from -30% we reached 7% excess as far as weekly rain is considered. This change was possible because of a low-pressure system that formed over Andhra Pradesh coast, a cyclonic circulation over west coast of India which brough rainfall throughout south peninsular India. Monsoon trough shifted to foothills during the end of the week causing heavy to extremely heavy rain in parts of northeast India,” said Soma Senroy, scientist at the National Weather Forecasting Centre of IMD.A fresh low-pressure area is likely to develop over northwest Bay of Bengal around September 20 which will bring heavy and widespread rains to east, northeast and peninsular India till end of September while northwest India is likely to record large deficiency. Between September 18 and 24 above normal rain is likely over west peninsular coast as westerlies strengthen due to development of the low-pressure area.Widespread and very heavy rain is likely over Kerala, Karnataka and Konkan and Goa from September 19 to 22. Extremely heavy rain is also very likely over Coastal Karnataka during September 19 to 20; over north Kerala and ghat sections of South Interior Karnataka on September 19 and 20; over south Konkan and Goa on September 21 and 22.Localized flooding of roads; water logging in low lying areas; mudslides; damage to horticulture and standing crops in some areas due to inundation and riverine flooding in some river catchments is likely in these areas, IMD said on Saturday. Extremely heavy rain is also likely over Arunachal Pradesh, Assam and Meghalaya, Sub-Himalayan West Bengal and Sikkim on September 22 and 23.There is a 12.5% deficiency in rain over the country in September; 53.9% deficiency over northwest India; 32.4% deficiency over central India; 4.4% deficiency over east and northeast India and 77.4% excess rain over peninsular India. In the monsoon season since June 1 there is 6.6% excess rain over the country; 15.5% deficiency over northwest India; 13.5% excess over central India; 1.5% excess over east and northeast India and 28.4% excess over south peninsula.“The circulation patterns are not suggesting withdrawal of monsoon yet. We are not seeing significant reduction in moisture. Westerly winds will strengthen next week due to development of low-pressure area,” explained K Sathi Devi, head, national weather forecasting centre
The National Investigation Agency (NIA) said on Saturday that it has busted an al Qaeda module and arrested nine people who were allegedly planning to carry out major terror strikes in India at the direction of their Pakistan-based handler.The nine suspects were picked up from West Bengal and Kerala on Saturday, people familiar with the developments said, requesting anonymity.The suspects, under the scanner for some time, were arrested after the agency learnt that they acquired large quantities of weapons, country-made firearms, locally fabricated body armour, jihadi literature, and literature used for making explosives, according to the officials cited above.The suspects were planning attacks at several locations, including Delhi-NCR, Kochi and Mumbai, and they were about to leave for Kashmir to receive a consignment of weapons, which was likely to arrive from Pakistan, the officials added.“NIA learnt about an inter-state module of al Qaeda operatives at various locations in India, including West Bengal and Kerala. The group was planning to undertake terrorist attacks at vital installations in India with an aim to kill innocent people and strike terror in their minds,” NIA spokesperson Sonia Narang said in a statement.“These individuals were radicalised by Pakistan-based al Qaeda terrorists on social media and were motivated to undertake attacks at multiple places, including the National Capital Region (NCR). For this purpose, the module was actively indulging in fund-raising and a few members of gang were planning to travel to New Delhi to procure arms and ammunition. These arrests have pre-empted possible terrorist attacks in various parts of the country,” the statement said.The handler of the module has been identified as Abu Hamza, who is in Pakistan. He is said to be directly linked to the main al Qaeda outfit headed by Ayman al-Zawahiri, according to the officials familiar with the investigation. The suspected Indian operatives were found to have been in touch with the leadership of the al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS), and not the general high command of the terror group.All nine suspects are residents of West Bengal. While three of them (Murshid Hasan, a labourer; Iyakub Biswas, a salesman; and Mosaraf Hossen, a cook at a small eatery) were held in Kerala’s Ernakulam, the remaining six (Abu Sufiyan, a tailor; Mainul Mondal, a cook; Leu Yean Ahmed, an electrician; Ali Mamun Kamal, a driver; and Najmus Sakib and Atitur Rahman, both pursuing graduation) were taken into custody from West Bengal’s Murshidabad.Murshid Hasan is believed to be heading the nine-member module and was receiving directions from Pakistan through social media.A senior official who did not want to be named said that the agency recovered YouTube videos of Murshid Hasan --- who is believed to have been in touch with the Pakistan-based handler for a year --- in which he purportedly threatened to kill non-Muslims. Also, the agency detected a YouTube channel of Leu Yean Ahmed on which he allegedly propagated jihadi ideology.
Economic growth will turn positive for Asia in the second half of this calendar year but the process of fiscal consolidation is set to be more protracted for the region, according to Fitch Ratings.Within South Asia, it forecast that India’s ratio of general government (GG) debt-to-GDP will stabilise in the fiscal year ending March 2022 at just above 85 per cent, from around 70 per cent before the coronavirus shock, as its economy recovers from a steep downturn.“There is uncertainty about the outlook, however, relating to India’s post-pandemic growth potential and fiscal policies,” Fitch added.The majority of rated sovereigns in the Asia Pacific will see a sustained increase in GG debt as a share of GDP in 2020-2022. “This is in line with our expectations for many other parts of the world, reflecting the lingering fiscal impact of coronavirus pandemic and the efforts to counter it.”Many Asian economies entered 2020 with fiscal policy space relative to rating peers to counter an unexpected downturn, like Indonesia, South Korea and New Zealand.“We have also indicated that rating decisions centred on the fiscal outlook will be guided in part by sovereigns’ record of fiscal consolidation in more favourable economic conditions. In some cases, failure to lower public debt-to-GDP ratios as the health crisis subsidies could add pressure on ratings,” said Fitch.The economic recovery will lift fiscal revenues and gradually reduce the need for crisis-related spending. Nevertheless, public debt will continue to rise as a share of GDP for more than half of Fitch-rated Asia Pacific sovereigns in both 2021 and 2022.This group includes some of the region’s biggest economies: China, South Korea, Australia and Indonesia.Both Pakistan and Sri Lanka have GG debt-to-GDP levels above the median for their rating peer group. “We believe Pakistan will start to lower its public debt-to-GDP ratio in 2022 under its IMF-supported programme, but we project a sustained increase for Sri Lanka throughout 2020-2022,” said Fitch.Significantly, it added, that economic forecasts for Asia as elsewhere remain subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to the evolution of pandemic. Geopolitical risks -- in particular trade tensions between the United States and China -- could also affect regional supply chains.

After a match that went down to the last over kicked things off in the IPL 2020, the second game of the tournament pits two of the original teams never to have won an IPL title. There are plenty of similarities between Kings XI Punjab and the Delhi Capitals. Both teams have an IPL history not to be too proud of. Both have shown tendencies to start a season well, and at the same time endure a slide that makes it almost impossible to play catch up. Last but not the least, glaringly enough, both teams have combined to bag the wooden spoon five times.However, that’s a trivia of the past. The ones of the present are that the Capitals’ unit has more or less maintained the same look as last year – one that saw them make it to the Playoffs for the first time since 2012 – with a few tweaks here and there. KXIP, on the other hand, look refreshed under the guidance of a new coach and captain in Anil Kumble and KL Rahul. Put all these elements together and what do you get? Two evenly-matched sides full of match-winners. The campaign will be a test particularly for KXIP though, given how well they began the 2019 edition before losing their way in the tournament. In the last five matches between the two sides, KXIP have won four.READ | IPL 2020, CSK vs MI: CSK take all setbacks in their stride, ease to victoryThat said, there are strengths and weaknesses in both teams and what better way to set the tone for the rest of the tournament than getting up and running early and chalking out a blueprint that can be amended as things progress. While Chennai Super Kings and the Royal Challengers Bangalore are known to make for the much-anticipated Southern Derby, up north, the Capitals and KXIP aren’t far behind highlighting the rivalry up north, and the first shot of a brand-new season will be fired Sunday.Team NewsDelhi CapitalsThe Capitals’ top order makes for itself with the likes of some star-studded Indian batsmen. Shikhar Dhawan and Prithvi Shaw as opener, followed by the middle-order trio of Shreyas Iyer, Ajinkya Rahane and Rishabh Pant. The big-hitting Shimron Hetmyer is expected to be in the mix of things as well, and as does R Ashwin, who will be up against the side he captained last year. Ishant Sharma is the leader of the pace attack which includes last year’s second-highest wicket-taker Kagiso Rabada and his South African teammate Anrich Nortje, while Leg-spinner Sandeep Lamichhane the second frontline spinner.Probable XI: 1 Shikhar Dhawan, 2 Prithvi Shaw, 3 Shreyas Iyer (Captain), 4 Ajinkya Rahane, 5 Rishabh Pant (WK), 6 Shimron Hetmyer, 7 R Ashwin, 8 Ishant Sharma, 9 Kagiso Rabada, 10 Anrich Nortje, 11 Sandeep LamichhaneKings XI PunjabKXIP boast a starry top three in KL Rahul, Chris Gayle and Mayank Agarwal. At the same time, their middle order looks a bit shaky with a little bit of inexperience. The pace battery looks impressive with Mohammed Shami leading an attack comprising 22-year-old Ishan Porel and West Indies quick Sheldon Cottrell. Murugan Ashwin and Mujeeb Ur Rahman are spin options KXIP should bank on given their ability to snap partnershipsProbable XI: 1 KL Rahul, 2 Chris Gayle, 3 Mayank Agarwal, 4 Sarfaraz Khan, 5 Nicholas Pooran, 6 Krishnappa Gowtham/Deepak Hooda, 7 Murugan Ashwin, 8 Mohammed Shami, 9 Ishan Porel, 10 Mujeeb-Ur-Rahman, 11 Sheldon CottrellStatistics- Ajinkya Rahane needs 12 more runs to reach 5000 runs in T20s. He will be the 10th Indian to the milestone- Shikhar Dhawan is four sixes away and Rishabh Pant is shy of six sixes to complete 100 IPL sixes.Players to watch out for- KXIP should look no further than KL Rahul for inspiration. In the last two seasons of the IPL, a red-hot Rahul burned up the charts with 659 in 2018 and 493 runs in 2019 respectively. Besides, Rahul would draw confidence from the fact that he was in tremendous form during India’s tour of New Zealand earlier this year. A third good IPL season on the trot would not only do a world of good to him but shoot his confidence ahead of next year’s T20 World Cup.- Rishabh Pant has been in the firing line for his inconsistent performance for India. That said, Pant had a wonderful IPL last year, scoring 488 runs including an explosive 78 not out against Mumbai Indians. Pant is a player to watch out for and if you’ve followed the Capitals’ social media handles, you’d know the power he packs behind those shots. A gun player, IPL 2020 could be the make or break season for the 21-year-old wicketkeeper.

Updated: Sep 18, 2020 19:00 ISTActor Sunny Leone has shared a cryptic post on social media, after her name was dragged into Kangana Ranaut’s ongoing public spat with Urmila Matondkar. Kangana had called Urmila a ‘soft porn star’ in a television interview, and had later justified her comment by suggesting that she hadn’t meant it in a derogatory manner, and pointing out that the film industry had welcomed former adult star Sunny Leone.Sunny on Friday took to Instagram to share a picture of herself, with the caption, “Lunch date! Catching up on world drama!” The second photo in her post was more telling, however. It read, “It’s funny how the people that know the least about you have the most to say.” Sunny’s post has been ‘liked’ over 400000 times. “Accurate!” one person wrote in the comments.Defending her comments against Urmila, Kangana had written in a tweet, “Liberal brigade once virtually lynched a renowned writer in to silence for saying people like Sunny Leone should not be our role models, Sunny is accepted by the industry and entire India as an artist, suddenly fake feminists equating being a porn star to something derogatory.”Kangana’s war of words with Urmila began when she appeared on television, and called Urmila a ‘soft porn star’ who, she said, is ‘not known for her acting’. Kangana was under the impression that Urmila had questioned her motives in her fight against the Shiv Sena. Urmila, speaking to journalist Barkha Dutt, said she had never brought up the BJP, or Kangana’s political motivations, in any interview.Sunny, who after a successful career as an adult performer in the US transitioned into a Bollywood actor, said that the journey to be accepted was filled with struggle. “My journey is so different from everybody out there, and I was fortunate that people accepted me. It took a while for people to do that, but even when I first got here, there was a vast majority of people who accepted me, and that is why I survived. It’s the fans who kept me alive, and kept everything going. If it was not for them, I don’t think I would be here,” she told Hindustan Times.Sunny is currently in the US with her husband and their three children, but said that she can’t wait to return to India, where her ‘heart’ is.
Twinkle Khanna gave us all a sneak peek into the birthday celebrations of son Aarav on Instagram. Akshay Kumar and Twinkle’s son Aarav turned 18 on Tuesday and the family celebrated with family in the UK where the actor is shooting Bell Bottom.“Happy 18th birthday Aarav! Here is something I had written for you once and to keep loosening the strings and finally cutting them off this year has not been easy,” Twinkle wrote with a photo featuring her, husband Akshay, daughter Nitara and Aarav. Everyone is sporting moustaches, perhaps following Akshay who now has a moustache for his film.Talking about raising Aarav to the young man he is today, Twinkle wrote, “All these years you have been as much my teacher as I have been yours. I learned optimism, kindness and wonder from you as I taught you maths, a few manners and how to switch the lights off when you leave the room.”She added about how her son is now looking forward to his life as an adult, “But looking at you growing up and listening to you repeatedly tell me how much you are looking forward to your independence, I have started realizing that when you finally leave my home, my world and step into your own, my lights will go off automatically and my world will be filled with a bleak darkness. Though whenever you return for a visit, I will light numerous diyas and pretend that this is not a permanent power failure; we are just celebrating Diwali. I am already missing the little boy you were but am so proud of the man you have become. #MamaBear.”Akshay and Twinkle are parents to Aarav and Nitara. Earlier, while talking to Bear Grylls, Akshay had said, “My son is very different. He just doesn’t want to tell anyone that he’s my son. He wants to be away from the limelight. He wants to have his own identity. That’s what the whole thing and I understand it. So, I let him be the way he wants to.”
Delhi’s second serological survey, which was conducted between August 1 and 7 and sampled 15,000 people, found that 29.1% of the city’s residents have developed antibodies against Covid-19. Extrapolating the findings to Delhi’s population would mean that around 5.8 million people in the city have been infected with Sars-CoV-2 at some point. This is a 6.2 percentage point increase from the first sero survey conducted around a month ago, which showed 22.86% people had developed antibodies. This proportion of infected has been extremely varied in the different sero surveys conducted across the country so far. Much of this variation may be because of sample sizes and sampling region within these cities. In Pune (sample size: 1,664), officials found that 51% of people had the antibodies earlier this week. In Mumbai (sample size: 6,936), this number was 40% at the end of July. In Ahmedabad (sample size: 30,054), 17.61% people exhibited seroprevalence at the end of July.Here is the good news. One, the findings show deaths have been lower than feared. As on August 7 (the last day of the sampling), Delhi had 4,082 deaths due to Covid-19. If this is pitted against the estimated 5.8 million infected, the infection fatality rate is 0.07%. Two, herd immunity is around the corner. Scientists say herd immunity occurs when a large proportion of the population contracts an infectious disease and build natural immunity to it. Once a certain percentage becomes immune, the disease starts running out of people to infect, and so the chain of transmission slows down, or halts entirely. With the vaccine still far off, herd immunity offers hope even though scientists remain divided on where this herd immunity threshold exactly lies.Now, the not-so-good news — testing has been woefully inadequate. By the government’s own numbers, there were 142,723 confirmed cases on the day the sero survey ended. But if 5.8 million people had been infected by August 7, then the testing strategy managed to only identify less than 2.5% of those infected. This means that it missed over 5.6 million infections, most of whom were probably asymptomatic. So, while the results show that Delhi is inching closer to herd immunity (and getting there faster than thought), it should also serve as a wake-up call to not let down one’s guard, particularly on the testing front.
Nearly 200 ‘irreplaceable’ books stolen in a sophisticated burglary by a Romanian gang in west London in January 2017 have been recovered from a village in Romania, Scotland Yard said on Friday.The books from the 16th, 17th and later centuries – including those of Isaac Newton, Galileo Galilei and Spanish painter Francisco Goya – have been described as ‘culturally significant’ and of international importance, worth more than £2.5 million.The books were stolen by members of a Romanian gang when they were stored in a transit warehouse in Feltham before being sent to Las Vegas for a specialist book auction.The suspects broke in by cutting holes in the roof and then abseiling down, avoiding many sensors. The books were stolen in 16 large bags, with the suspects leaving the same way they entered.Detective inspector Andy Durham said: “These books are extremely valuable, but more importantly they are irreplaceable and are of great importance to international cultural heritage”.“If it wasn’t for the hard work of Detective Constable David Ward and others in this Joint Investigation Team, these books would have been sadly lost to the world forever.”Scotland Yard’s investigation identified that the suspects involved were part of the Romanian gang that was responsible for high-value warehouse burglaries across the UK.The police said the gang flies members into the UK to commit specific offences and then fly them out of the country shortly afterwards, with the stolen property taken out of the country by other gang members using different transport methods.The gang, the police added, is linked to a number of prominent Romanian crime families who form part of the Clamparu crime group, based in the Iași region in Eastern Romania and has a history of complex and large-scale high value thefts, yet avoided prosecution by offending outside Romania.A joint operation with the Romanian National Police and Italian Carabinieri, supported by Europol and Eurojust culminated in coordinated arrests and searches of 45 addresses across the UK, Romania and Italy in June 2019.Thirteen individuals were charged in the UK with conspiring to commit burglaries between December 2016 and April 2019, and to acquire criminal property. Court proceedings continue, with 12 individuals already pleading guilty.
Ace filmmaker SS Rajamouli, who will soon resume work on his upcoming Telugu magnum opus Roudram Ranam Rudhiram (RRR), along with his wife Rama recently visited the Bandipur Tiger Reserve forest in Karnataka and spent some quality time. Pictures from their trip have gone viral on social media.As per reports, Rajamouli and his wife visited Bandipur Tiger Reserve on Wednesday. They also made a pit stop at the ancient Himavad Gopalaswamy temple. The couple is said to have performed a special puja at the temple. They also spent time exploring the wildlife in the forest.Rajamouli and Rama at the Himavad Gopalaswamy temple.Meanwhile, the shooting of RRR is expected to resume from October 5. The film stars Jr NTR and Ram Charan in the lead roles. RRR will be a fictional story set in the 1920s pre-independent era and it will be based on the lives of two real heroes and well-known revolutionaries – Alluri Sitarama Raju and Komaram Bheem.“This will be a fictional story on the lives of Alluri Sitarama Raju and Komaram Bheem. There are gaps in the lives of these legendary freedom fighters that we don’t know about. We don’t know what happened in their lives in these years. It is through this fictional story we’d like to show what could have happened in their lives and what would have happened if they met and bonded,” Rajamouli said at the film’s launch last year.RRR will be released in 10 Indian languages next year. Presented by D Parvathy, the film is being produced under the DVV Entertainments banner by DVV Danayya.The producer has already made it clear that the film will be made with high standards that will elevate the stature of Telugu cinema even further after Baahubali.The film also stars Ajay Devgn, Alia Bhatt and Samuthirakani in key roles. Both Ajay and Alia will be making their Telugu debut with this project. Recent reports indicate that Ajay Devgn plays the mentor of Jr NTR and Ram Charan in the flashback episode. Shriya Saran has been roped in as Ajay’s pair and the duo will be reuniting after working together in Drishyam.
A lawyer for Julian Assange told a London court on Friday that she was present when an ally of US President Donald Trump offered to arrange a pardon for the WikiLeaks founder in return for information that would “benefit President Trump politically”.Australian-born Assange, 49, is fighting to avoid being sent to the United States, where he is charged with conspiring to hack government computers and violating an espionage law over the release of confidential cables by WikiLeaks in 2010-2011.His lawyer, Jennifer Robinson, said in a witness statement to the court that she observed a meeting at the Ecuadorian embassy in London in 2017 between Assange and Republican then-US Representative Dana Rohrabacher.She said Rohrabacher and an assistant offered to arrange a pardon for Assange in return for information about the hacking of Democratic emails before the 2016 US presidential election.“They stated that President Trump was aware of and had approved of them coming to meet with Mr Assange to discuss a proposal – and that they would have an audience with the President to discuss the matter on their return to Washington DC,” she said.“The proposal put forward by Congressman Rohrabacher was that Mr. Assange identify the source for the 2016 election publications in return for some form of pardon, assurance or agreement, which would both benefit President Trump politically and prevent US indictment and extradition,” Robinson said.Assange’s legal team first said at hearings in February that Rohrabacher had conveyed a pardon offer to Assange. At the time, the White House called the assertion that Trump had tried to reach a deal with Assange “a complete fabrication and a total lie”.Rohrabacher said he had never spoken with the president about Assange, denied being sent on Trump’s behalf and said he was acting on his own when he offered to ask Trump for a pardon for Assange.Robinson said Rohrabacher’s offer was presented to Assange as a “win-win” solution that would allow Assange “to get on with his life” and in return would also politically benefit Trump.During the 2016 US presidential campaign, WikiLeaks published a series of Democratic National Committee emails damaging to candidate Hillary Clinton. US investigators have concluded that the emails were hacked by Russia as part of an effort to influence the election.The 2016 election leaks are not directly a part of the US criminal case against Assange, which covers secret military and diplomatic documents published by WikiLeaks several years earlier.Russia has denied meddling in the 2016 election and Trump has denied that his campaign colluded with Moscow.Assange is fighting the US extradition request, arguing that the Trump administration has brought charges against him for political reasons.In 2012, Assange took refuge in Ecuador’s London embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden where he was accused of sex crimes, which he denied and which were later dropped. After seven years, he was dragged from the embassy by British police in 2019. (Reporting by Andrew MacAskill Editing by Guy Faulconbridge, William Maclean and Peter Graff)
Updated: Sep 19, 2020 16:48 ISTMusic composer Ismail Darbar has confirmed that his son, social media influencer Zaid Darbar, is dating actor Gauahar Khan. He said that Zaid called up his stepmother, Ismail’s wife Ayesha, and told her about the relationship.Zaid and Gauahar were first linked together last month and have been sharing mushy Instagram posts with each other. While they have not officially confirmed their relationship, Ismail seems to have let the cat out of the bag.In an interview with The Times of India, Ismail gave his stamp of approval to Zaid and Gauahar’s relationship. “If Zaid and Gauahar get married, why won’t I give aashirwad to Gauahar? If Zaid wants to marry her, why would I object? Zaid is nearly 29, he knows what he’s doing. In fact, that’s exactly what Ayesha told him. She told him that if he’s happy we’re happy too, and he is old enough to decide what’s good for him,” he said.On Friday, Gauahar shared a picture of Zaid kissing her on the forehead and wrote, “Dua mein yaad rakhna (Remember us in your prayers)! #Jumma what is Zaid telling me to make me smile??? Batao .... @zaid_darbar #NoOtherLikeYou #Gaza.” He commented, “I was saying ‘Ramzaan ki dua kaam ayi (The Ramzaan prayers worked)’.”Last month, on Gauahar’s birthday, Zaid shared pictures from the blue-themed celebration and wrote on Instagram, “So I guess it’s never too much blue with us! I wish I could type everything right here but I’d rather keep it small & express in front of you. You know what you mean to me G, happiest birthday Gau-ahar-jeous @gauaharkhan.”ALSO WATCH | Whom Gauahar Khan is thinking about during lockdownGauahar has worked in a number of films.

With several ministers and MPs testing positive for Covid-19, Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu on Saturday urged members to wear masks, maintain a safe distance and follow good hygiene norms of washing hands and eat healthy.As the House met for the day, Naidu said the Covid-19 testing facility, both rapid antigen and RT-PCR, will be available in Parliament House everyday throughout the current session.“Members are advised to avail this facility and get their test done,” he said, adding that a significant number of oximeters to check the oxygen saturation level were also available.Naidu said officials have told him that the best safeguard against the virus is the mask.“Wearing a mask is important whenever you meet a person outside your house, including outsiders working in your house. This is very important,” he said, adding that the second most important thing is maintaining a safe distance.The third important thing is maintaining hygiene by washing hands.“The fourth thing is about the need to keep immunity levels of your body. That is possible by healthy food habits, a healthy lifestyle and also some amount of exercise,” he said.Naidu also said members should keep distance while interacting with each other. “Do not cross that six-feet limit and do not bend on other member’s side and try to wish him. If it is very important, send a slip. Otherwise, you can go out,” he said asking members not to physically reach out to officers or the Chair.The members can convey their problems or grievances by writing, he said. “That is the best way. I hope everyone of our members will remember these four things that have been stated by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), health ministry and the home ministry and cooperate so that we can operate and complete our business at the earliest, and go back to serve our people,” he said.
In a major success, anti narcotics task force foiled a smuggling bid and recovered a huge consignment of high grade Hashish or hash worth crores headed for Mumbai and arrested two interstate smugglers in Jammu on Saturday.The accused have been identified as Ali Mohammad and Aamin Khan of Somalpur, Ajmer in Rajasthan.Senior superintendent of police (SSP) ANTF J&K, Vinay Sharma stated that an information from reliable sources was received about a truck (number RJ10GB-3411) parked near Tawi bridge on Nagrota- Narwal bypass road in Jammu, in which, a large quantity of Hashish was concealed in apple boxes and was being smuggled from Kashmir to Mumbai.Also Read: Anurag Kashyap claims Ravi Kishan used to smoke weed, opens up on his own struggle.“During a search of the truck, 35 kg of Hashish like substance was recovered.

Updated: Sep 18, 2020 17:18 ISTResearchers have developed a new rapid test for the detection of the novel coronavirus that can be performed in less than an hour, and with minimal equipment, and “can detect nearly as many cases as the standard Covid-19 diagnostic.”With further research, the scientists, including those from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the US, said the new test, known as STOPCovid, could be made cheaply enough so that people could test themselves every day. In the study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the researchers showed that the new test detected 93% of the positive cases as determined by conventionally used Covid-19 diagnostic.“We need rapid testing to become part of the fabric of this situation so that people can test themselves every day, which will slow down outbreak,” said study co-author Omar Abudayyeh from MIT.The researchers hope the test could be further developed for use in point-of-care settings, such as doctors’ offices, pharmacies, nursing homes, and schools.While other tests based on CRISPR technology provide a method for the the detection of viral pathogens, the scientists said these are more complex than the ones used in point-of-care testing. They explained that such tests depend on an RNA extraction process and multiple liquid-handling steps that increase the risk of cross-contamination of samples.“We developed STOPCovid so that everything could be done in a single step,” said Julia Joung, another co-author of the study from MIT. “A single step means the test can be potentially performed by nonexperts outside of laboratory settings,” Joung said.In the latest version of STOPCovid, reported in the study, the researchers incorporated a process to concentrate the viral genetic material in a patient sample by adding magnetic beads that attract RNA. They said this step eliminates the need for expensive purification kits that are time-intensive and can be in short supply due to high demand. According to the researchers, this concentration step boosts the test’s sensitivity so that it now approaches that of the conventionally used PCR diagnostic method.“Once we got the viral genomes onto the beads, we found that that could get us to very high levels of sensitivity,” said Jonathan Gootenberg, another co-author of the study.The researchers tested STOPCovid on 402 patient samples -- 202 positive and 200 negative -- and found that it detected 93 percent of the positive cases as determined by the standard US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) PCR test.They said the STOPCovid test works on samples taken using the less invasive anterior nasal swab.The scientists are currently testing it with saliva samples, which they said may make at-home tests even easier to perform. “The goal is to make this test easy to use and sensitive, so that we can tell whether or not someone is carrying the virus as early as possible,” said Feng Zhang, a co-author of the study from MIT.

US median household income hit a record high in 2019 and the poverty rate fell, according to a government survey released on Tuesday that offered a snapshot of the economy before millions of American jobs were destroyed by the coronavirus pandemic.The US Census Bureau said real median household income jumped 6.8% from $64,324 in 2018 to $68,703 last year - the highest since the agency began tracking the data in 1967.It also said the nation’s poverty rate fell last year to 10.5%, a 1.3-percentage-point drop. Another measure of poverty that adjusts for government aid programs for low-income Americans showed a drop to 11.7% last year from 12.8% in 2018.At the same time, however, the number of people without health insurance for at least part of the year hit 29.6 million, up one million from the year before. The number of uninsured children also grew.The report offered a look back at the state of the economy before the novel coronavirus outbreak hit the United States early this year, shuttering many businesses as the country sought to contain the pandemic.Since then, more than 6.5 million people in the United States have contracted the highly contagious virus and more than 194,000 have died. Vast swaths of the economy were devastated and 22 million Americans were thrown out of work.While activity is now rebounding, economists warn that the recovery may be uneven as federal stimulus money runs out with no signs of replenishment from Washington. A potential second wave of Covid-19 infections this autumn and winter as people move back indoors also looms large.President Donald Trump, who had staked his re-election on economic gains before the outbreak, has downplayed impact of the virus and the risk of another wave, as he has urged states to fully re-open. He has also repeatedly touted gains on Wall Street - a narrow gauge of economic performance - and pledged to rebuild the economy if he wins a second term.His Democratic rival in the Nov. 3 election, former Vice President Joe Biden, has said the gains since Covid-19 emerged have been uneven and have left many segments of the working population still reeling.“Those at the top see things going up. But those in the middle and below see things getting worse. And we have leaders who bear false witness, want us to believe that our country isn’t gone off track,” Biden said on Monday.A Reuters/Ispos poll in late August showed American’s support for Trump’s handling of the economy has slipped.The income and poverty data for 2019, the last year of the economic expansion following the 2007-2009 Great Recession, “do not reflect the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic or the current recession,” Census’ Social, Economic and Housing Statistics Division chief David Waddington told reporters on a conference call.Census officials and private economists cautioned that the Covid-19 outbreak impacted data collection as the agency suspended in-person interviews earlier this year.
